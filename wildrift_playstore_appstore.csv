5,Google Play,"Even though it's good quality game, current matchmaking and how disruptive behavior is ignored are complete joke. Current matchmaking seems to punish you for playing well by matching you with trolls/low skill players to balance the team? Ridiculous. This is the reason why trolls and bad players are seen in higher ranks because they don't get punished. Ranks themself should sort players by their skill level. Not some rigged matchmaking in solo que. And auto response.. Such a bad experience.",1,,3,2023-11-08 00:44:18,Reach out to us with a ticket at https://support-legendsofruneterra.riotgames.com/ and we can figure out what happened!,2022-10-08 23:08:26

8,Google Play,"Wild Rift is an impressive mobile game. The gameplay itself, when you get past the initial queue area for a mobile game, is 5 stars. The main game mode I play is ARAM, which consists of the worst balancing I've ever seen in a game. They give champions that easily one shot you normally (Zed, Akali) huge buffs on ARAM (20% bonus damage and 20% damage reduction). Due to the most stupid balancing I've ever seen in a game, I can only rate it 2 stars",2,,287,2023-11-08 00:23:55,,

14,Google Play,Ranked matchmaking is nonexistent. if you're half decent at league dont bother playing ranked unless you're playing with a full squad. it will literally match you with afk inters every single game if your MMR is even remotely decent. Solo ranked is not worth. Riot this is inexcusable and needs to be fixed. either add solo only matchmaking or remove ranked. I dont need compensation for afk people. they need to be punished more severely or blocked from competitive ranked completely.,1,,0,2023-11-07 22:22:06,Please reach out to us with a ticket at https://support-wildrift.riotgames.com/ and we can figure out what happened!,2023-11-07 22:16:24

It's your lame app's stability issue. I have the s22 ultra and this SHOULD NOT be an issue for newer phones, heck even older phones.

Only real issues is that match making is really bad for PVP and Ranked!!! You either get low level teammates or a higher leveled ememy team!!! Also it has a fairly new gacha system that isn't fair and promotes gambling!!! Plus it's extremely difficult and take a long time to get any skins without paying!!!

8160,Google Play,A good take on the PC version overall. My only concern is the penalty system. Kudos to riot for being more firm on the penalty system but there are situations where the AFKs or disconnects are valid and are not due to player's actions. highly recommend a function where the game will be able to identify bad connectivity or having to make a call from deliberate and intentional AFK.

9434,Google Play,The game has turned out nicely on the new update and its been a nice experience for me. The things i would prefer to be worked on is how its different from other mobas because they all have the same things such as real money skins or a normal ranking system. the legendary rank match and its parent game do make it sort of different but i think it can be better if it was more different. in terms of gameplay i think azir and fiddlesticks would make it feel like the parent game which is good.,4,,0,2023-07-31 16:58:18,,

But this game just pales in so many aspects and I feel I waste my time trying to get interested in very limited playstyle and simplistics. Huge part of me wishes this was more like league.

0,App Store,"This game is amazing especially when you compare it to the other games on the market. All the bad reviews I see and just pc players complaining about how it’s not the same. It’s not lol on mobile it’s mobile lol. Ofc you can’t react as fast and ofc the controls won’t be as smooth but you’re not on a pc you’re on your phone what did you expect, them to copy and paste the game and everything work the same 🤪.One reason is they aren’t constantly trying to get you to spend money after every game you play. Another is no character is so extremely op that they can literally kill you by themselves with two auto attacks like in mobile legends or arena of valor. It’s very balanced. Because it’s so balanced teamfights actually matter and they aren’t just a spam of abilities and whoever has the most dps wins. I don’t wanna make this review too long bcuz then no one will read it but the only problem I have with this game at the moment is that sometimes you’ll get out in a game and everyone will pick their characters and then the game will say failed to connect and when you try and rejoin it says the game already ended. The games isn’t in your match history either which shows that it’s not just your WiFi cutting out.",4,Best Mobile MOBA by far,,2021-04-14 14:15:55,,
1,App Store,"This game is made beautifully! There for sure is a lot more to come since the PC version has been out since the stone ages and there’s, I’d say, less than half the champions available now on the mobile version.
There’s always an event happening and getting materials to buy new champions is fairly quick. I’d say too quick to be honest, considering most events you get the new champion for free if you participate.
Mechanically not the greatest but compared to other MOBAS for mobile, it’s one of the best. 
One thing I don’t enjoy about Wild Rift is matchmaking. I’m no pro and far from one, but it’s hard to rank up and when analyzing how much damage I am doing and even absorbing compared to my teammates, just about every other match I do and take nearly the most besides a tank and maybe a support if we had a hybrid. Sometimes even more damage than the entire enemy team which is hard to ignore. It would be nice if “skill level” was not based on more than it is now which seems like it’s just your current rank. One other improvement I want to speak on is being able to see skin effects before buying them. If I am going to purchase a skin for my earned money, I want to know what it comes with such as sound and visual effects that change with the champions skill like the “Arcade” series. Anyways, still excited I don’t need to be on PC to play one of my all time favorite games!",5,Best MOBA for Mobile hands down,,2022-05-18 07:52:45,,
2,App Store,"So much better than Arena of Valor. Wasn’t expecting decent gameplay on mobile platforms but on the iPad Pro, this game is phenomenally good. Buttery smooth frame rate at 120fps, not a hitch in graphics at all on a 3rd gen iPad Pro, if you have something newer then you’ll be good for a while as well. Like that I can log in with existing account for Riot. You can buy buttons to stick on the screen if you don’t like the thumb movement control. I tend to slide around further than the designated circle for movement. Everything else is fine though. The game is easier to play on a touch screen than I would have imagined. I would like to see controller support added though. Arena of Valor was put on Nintendo switch and it works fantastic there. Better yet, put Wild Rift on Nintendo switch as well please, and don’t separate it from the mobile player base like AoV did (that’s why it’s dying on switch). Since apple has allowed controllers via Bluetooth, it should be considered for moba titles on iOS/iPad OS. The only other gripe I have is that nothing transfers over in terms of purchased characters from the PC version. You do seem to get a new hero every time you level up though which is nice. The premium pass is cheap at only ten bucks for extra funsies. Bring controller support and allow things to transfer over like purchased hero’s and skins and this game will be by far the best moba on mobile platforms.",5,Unexpectedly good,,2021-11-11 08:09:36,,
3,App Store,"Never married before, but I haven’t touched grass in eleven months since I started playing, so I probably will never have the chance again. I played Wild Rift first on my iPad, after seeing many friends constantly on League proper. I played for a number of months, learning all the champions and grinding ranked. Eventually, I felt like I’d reached my limit, and because of how good this (mobile) game is, I purchased a PC to play the full thing! But to my surprise, Wild Rift still stands in its own right and is as good as the game in many places, sometimes MUCH BETTER than the original. Weaker points are mostly related to superficial factors, the frequent empty headed plays from people playing at work/in class/etc, feeders or inting players, toxic individuals in chat, leavers, and so on. Where the game soars is in its excellent pacing of each match, the punishing but also extremely enjoyable ranked systems(and now legendary update!), and the graphics that are somehow better than the main game. I mean, seriously, the fact that the client interface looks better than the PC game puts those developers to shame. All this to say, Wild Rift team has created something that will be around and exponentially permeating through mobile society for many years to come. I’m excited to see where they take both the casual and competitive scene from here. INSTALL THE GAME AND ENTER THE RIFT!!!",5,This Game Lost Me My Wife and Kids,,2022-07-17 06:47:02,,
4,App Store,"Great game! It’s league but at the convenience of being accessible at your fingertips. Yeah, there are short comings especially compared to it’s counter part being played on pcs, macs, and other computers. You can’t expect the full experience while being on a phone, but, you still get reactive, real time combat and controls, tons of different characters with their own unique abilities and own influence on the overall strategic play through of 5 versus 5. Game mechanics make it extremely insensitive to players who lose connection or have their own phone die during game, resulting in a disciplinary “time-out,” requiring players to wait until their able to play a match (without any possibility for you to defend the reason behind why the “AFK” happened). Also depending on server maintenance and your own internet ping, you may experience a terrible game simply because you cannot react in time due to time lapse in between members of the match. Lastly, many people say it’s a harsh game on people who pay to play compared to the free to play players. It’s absolutely wrong! LOL has ALWAYS been a free to play game. If you want to look cool and buy a skin then go ahead, but it’s the people who know the mechanics, implement strategy and never even have to pay a dime of RWC that actually dominate this amazing game!",5,LOL on a phone!,,2023-01-12 05:00:41,,
5,App Store,"First let me just say, for those players who are saying just play pc league need to stop because there is a good market for mobile play and honestly some people don’t have the time investment to play an hour long game and some people don’t have PC set ups to run smooth games. Do not be discouraged by the reviews and try it out! It’s got amazing graphics, very smooth gameplay that has a greater emphasis on teamwork, a nice clean interface that isn’t too overwhelming and other little baubles you can play around with to customize your gameplay and controls to fit your needs. There is definitely room to improve but it is still in beta so it’s not even the full game yet.

As someone who plays mobile games and specifically mobile MOBA’s, I can honestly say that Wild Rift is something that blows most other mobas out of the water. Obviously with league to base off of it’s bound to be good but what sets it apart from games like Mobile Legends or Arena of Valor is the fact that it feels strongly team based rather than a heavy reliance on over powered champions to make a random team comp in order to overwhelm a more balanced team. There are certainly overpowered champions that can carry in WR too but at the very least you can come back with some patience.",5,Wonderfully made for mobile!,,2021-06-09 23:29:55,,
6,App Store,"The game overall is fine. However when the LoL community has been asking for major improvements for months they never deliver. The worst thing that can happen is a “chat ban”. However these same kids are still ruining games and refuse to surrender causing suffering for 4 other players. Riot you need to step up your game and start giving out harsher punishments. Instead of an”temporary chat restriction” how about a Ranked restriction? Where the player cannot que ranked for 2-8 weeks. This game used to be fun and competitive however it’s over run with the same toxic PC community. It’s a little insane. I tell myself ok I’ll try again tomorrow and the next day the first 5 games include all toxic children or leavers. Makes the game not even playable. I hope this reaches out to a game dev or someone. You guys need to fix match making to have limits too. Being Diamond should not allow gold/plats just because the “system thinks their doing well”. It should absolutely not allow people two entire tiers below you. Literally ruins the game. It should be iron/silver gold/plat Em/Diamond, not allow a gold 4 in an emerald 1 game. Anyway. You guys need to stop dropping the ban hammer and get control of this toxic player base in NA. Speaking of which, I live in the United States. I am never paired on teams with people who speak English. Latins need their own server. I haven’t seen another player who speaks English in months.

7,App Store,"It’s fun for an occasional game on the go, but it’s nothing compared to the original PC version. The controls are a bit clunky although I don’t really play mobile games. The auto targeting is a little buggy as some long range abilities such as Lux’s ult will sometimes lock on to a jungle camp instead of the enemy champion, and for melee champs it is difficult to target an enemy champion if they are standing too close to minions with only your finger and not the precision of an actual mouse. There’s no draft picking at this time so champ select can be rough, especially when you get queued with newer players who may not understand roles. I’ve ended up in a few matches with only supports on my team, which wasn’t a fun time. 

Some additions to the game such as mirror lanes are completely unnecessary and make things more complicated than they need to be, especially for newer players. I opened a ticket with Riot to see if there was an option somewhere to disable the mirror lanes, and the person who wrote me back said that there wasn’t but agreed that it caused things to be messy! Hopefully if their own team thinks this they will add an option to disable it soon. Also with as much time and effort as I’ve put into the pc version as far as unlocking champions and skins, I wish at least some of that could carry over, rather than treating this as an entirely different game.",3,It’s ok but much prefer the original version of League,,2021-04-04 06:44:32,,
8,App Store,"The game on mobile is pretty fun. I like the idea and concept and have a good understanding of how LoL works. I dislike the matchmaking and how it is not skill based (especially your teammates) and hate that I’m having to carry every game in order to get to higher ranks. That’s not a big issue though because that’s to be expected in almost every game.
My main issue lies with the fact that on random days for random amounts of time, I won’t be able to play games on my main account. I’ll log in thinking I’ll be able to play a game while I’m on the go and then find that I don’t see my friends that are online, my profile picture, my rank, and the wild pass. All of these things are just missing and at first I thought it was a wifi issue but when I made a second account that issue wasn’t happening on that account. This bug is super annoying to deal with especially because I did grind events to get skins on it and would like to use them. This bug also makes it so that every 10-15 seconds you get a loading “L” (the League of Legends symbol). This bug fix would make the game much more enjoyable and fun.
Overall it’s a good game the concept and idea is super cool. Would also love to see more game modes that we see on PC like URF, ARAM, etc.
Sadly, until this bug is fixed I will not be playing this game and will have it uninstalled.

9,App Store,"Probably the best MOBA I’ve ever played.  I’ve tried other MOBA on iOS and they can’t compare to this game.  This game combat is so much nicer and polished than others.  You don’t have to worry about auto targeting at minions when being ganked or in 1v1.  Other MOBAs had those issues even after I messed around with the settings.  Everything seems really balanced and I haven’t experienced games where someone would 2 shot me mid-game.  Champions and skins are actually obtainable by just playing the game unlike most other MOBAs I’ve played MOBAs where you would have to grind forever or wait till events pops up just to have half of the price of the champion you want.  HUD is really good and doesn’t cover your whole screen and the lighting is nice and smooth.  Although Wild Rift’s champions have been fleshed out more than their competitors, the champions designs and abilities are really nice and doesn’t seem too uninspired like other MOBAs I’ve played.  This game is a little more competitive than other MOBAs I’ve played but who doesn’t like a little challenge.

11,App Store,"I’ve been playing league since 2011 and have a pretty good understanding of the simple to intermediate aspects of the game. One aspect of wild rift that is almost non-existent is the support role. There is no “support item” tabs, but there are some support items but you have to dig to find them. Though there is an easy way to target enemies, there is not a option or function to interact with allies quickly. This makes targeting teammates almost impossible during a team fight and renders the support useless.
One key feature of this game that is incredibly frustrating is the character control speed vs. skill shot speed. I would HIGHLY recommend a tweaking of this system. In pc version of league, reacting and dodging skill shots is almost instantaneous because of clicking. However, the transition to mobile kept skill shots at the same travel speed, but users now have to drag their thumb across a screen to dodge skill shots which delays the reaction time. I have never had this much of an issue dodging skill shots on the pc and the above reason is my opinion as to why it is soooo much harder to pull off. 
I will be deleting this app until these (mainly the support issues) are addressed. I also have an issue with not having access to skins I paid for in the pc version of the game.

So I stuck with Vi and leveled her up (by grinding, aka multiple defeats and deaths for chump change reward) and am now on my third attempt with 1 revive that came as part of her most recent level… something like 13 or 14. 
     I really enjoy the game but I think having such a hard map after just cruising the begging was rather thoughtless and cruel.  My joy of the game has vanished and it’s become more of a task and choir. I probably won’t continue if I can’t defeat the Gang plank map by level 15.
     The game is fantastic so I give it five stars, but the legion marauders infinite multiplier take 1 star away. Since there isn’t anyway to heal between the marauders and Swain, another star is destroyed (see how the game plays?). For the constant hammering of Swain taking 1 from nexus without offering a way to balance the fight(usually starting with 15 or less on nexus) another star is destroyed. For the lopsided randomness that favors the Ai another star.

With the roles I understand the importance of everyone being active in the match and the desire to punish those who go AFK or abandon the team. Yes that can be annoying. But banning someone from playing for an hour is a bit much. And if it happens too often in a week then it doubles, and the next thing you know it’s 6 hours, maybe longer before you can play again. Sometimes life doesn’t let you play uninterrupted. Maybe you’re in the middle of a game and you have to make a choice between life, family, friends, and a GAME. The sane person would choose the former, but then you can’t have the downtime you need later because you’ve been temporarily blocked from playing. Oh and if you had to leave but then didn’t immediately get back in to manually accept to the restriction, then when you finally are able to login it sometimes starts the counter at that moment instead of when you quit which makes it even longer. It gets ridiculous. I’ve never seen a game that punishes you so much for trying to balance life and the need for distraction that made you download the game in the first place.

Well the matchmakin system puts total scrubs and trolls who play LOWER than that elo(whatever elo that may be, platinum or grandmaster or whatever) and that one player just drags the whole rest of the team down with how they play. It also makes us lose games and LP when we ourselves r actually trying to advance into the next rank. I’ve been in mid platinum to lower emerald for the past few months now and bc of said people in my team I always get demoted except for the  seemingly rare games where I get people who play at their elo level or higher.

Wild Rift offers lovely visuals, an awesome array of champions, and a litany of nice resources to take advantage of for the purposes of “learning the ropes.” I’m determined to keep a relatively casual mindset when playing this game, while at the same time trying to become a skilled and proficient player that adds value to my team. With this casual (but focused) disposition towards the game, I don’t plan on viciously clawing my way up the ranks, nor do I plan on griefing people who don’t stay in their lane (literally). It’s just a game and I don’t want to take it too seriously; in my opinion games lose their enjoyment too quickly when they’re taken too seriously. All that to say, if you’re like me and like quality & playability then you’ll probably enjoy this game and more than likely won’t experience the toxicity that the leaderboard junkies will either (a) run into themselves, or (b) promulgate. Enjoy the game, have fun, don’t take it too seriously. Temper your expectations.",5,"Solid Game, Just Temper Expectations",,2021-09-20 20:08:45,,
19,App Store,"This game is a fairly faithful adaptation of the original pc version, it’s stripped down for the mobile platform but overall plays pretty similar. My problem is not with the game itself but the player base (obviously not everyone). League is already an extremely toxic game, couple that with the mobile multiplayer base and you have a recipe for disaster. The toxicity seems lower at first because of the hassle of chat on a mobile device, however the problems occur more in game than in chat. I frequently get players in ranked mode who obviously have never played the game or at least haven’t for very long, locking into a role they don’t know how to play with a champion they’ve also never played before. Very little effort is put into the overall team in this team based game, although this seemed to get better in higher elos. If you’re not willing to grind out a ton of games to get out of bronze and silver, you’ll probably have a bad time with this game. I’d recommend to anyone who plays league regularly and just want something to play be it on a long car ride or to kill 15 minutes while waiting for something, other than that, unless you’re actually willing to learn the game, please stay out of my ranked lobbies",3,Just play pc league,,2021-04-11 06:15:53,,
20,App Store,"Wild Rift is absolutely amazing. Great graphics, not p2w, competitive gameplay, good controls, an active development team who actually care about the game and tons of additional content. However, the match making system is horrifically bad. There is never really any chance for comeback once you get behind. I have been playing for a few months now and I’ve accomplished maybe 2 comeback wins. There are too many factors that can make you lose the game. One of your laners falls way behind and feeds the enemy. Someone goes AFK. Your jungle doesn’t gank. It feels like you’ll know if you win or lose at the beginning of the game and there is no way to change that. I’ve started playing PVP over Ranked because it destroys my mental trying to rank up and losing no matter what I do. I’ve had 25+ kill games and lost because my team couldn’t pull their weight. Match making needs a huge overhaul imo. However it is a fantastic game, i wish you didnt have to purchase champions but i dont think that'll ever change. The best MOBA on mobile by far.

21,App Store,"This game is as fun as LoL but hilariously horrible at math. From 100 health - 800dmg = 1200 health to 40% health - 10% health= dead. And my favorite is a cold hard 60 damage is 63% of 2,600. It’s insane haha. Health bars are just ornaments that don’t correlate to gameplay at this point. There’s also a lot of hit box issues and attacks hitting far outside their visuals. Not to mention auto attack for a lot of abilities is random at best even when you’re locked on and standing still there’s still a 1/6 chance you’ll fire in a random direction. The game runs smooth at 60 fps with 19ms so you’d never expect it to be lag or anything. I guess they figured it’s an arcade game so who cares about the math. Until you get to a point in rank when it matters to you. Also wouldn’t hurt to reconfigure who gets the kill. You never notice it unless you play aram. If you do, play as pyke and sit in spawn to get good kills xD 

Community is as toxic as any competitive PC game too. They got rid of all chat so now it’s just people constantly throwing games by talking trash to teammates. You’d think they realize it doesn’t help anyone. Everyone is an expert who has never had a bad game but is gold 2. Go figure.

Match making system is the biggest broken thing in this game and second one is AFK and TROLLS. Whats happening? Its realy that hard to put some main things from pc version to receive a better quality of gaming? Where is a dodge system from matchmaking? Where is an early surrender if some1 goes afk and points doesnt lost? Another one FAIL. You said working on mmr and fixed it. What did you fixed? I got 4 ranked matches in a row with unranked, bronze, silver teammates, while i m in emerald. Whats this? Who will give me back my lost points of your system fail? Its impossible to play solo que and a lot people will agree with this. At first Focus on the gameplay, not on your wildpasses or other things. I played few times MOBA LEGENDS and i can say guys uhhh, you need a loooot of work to reach that game level...

I play ranked every single day, and through all of the trolls and afk people that I had to go through I finally made it to Diamond. I rarely ever have deaths over four and statistically are shown that I’m better than most in my rank. It was difficult enough having to grind all the way from ground up and to Diamond with all of the disgusting behavior. With the recent update, all players that were in lower Diamond (which wasn’t my fault.. I was at Diamond 2 before I got hit hard with trolls), we were all demoted to Platinum. Now I have to pair up with way lower skilled players AND trolls. Trying to get over ranking issues and reports never mattering, I recently purchased the Redeeming Star Guardian Pass. The developers are SO greedy that they limited the Star Guardian skins that come in one of the mission boxes. I’ve been wanting Star Guardian Seraphine but now won’t be able to get her due to the paywall. It’s always about money. I buy the battle pass every month.

That being said the only problem I have with this game is that it doesn’t clarify a whole lot on lanes and what champions are what so when you start a game with what looks like a good team build you’ll have a support going mid when someone else already chose a mid champ or the duo lane players going to solo lane or jungle not jungling and making the solo lane a duo lane. It gets a little frustrating losing games because people simply haven’t been given enough info to know these basic things. Done with the negative on to the positive. This game is amazingly built. No it is not the same as pc but in some ways it’s even more enjoyable. It’s great that right from the start you’re able to build your champion pool so much early on rather than having to grind or pay money. The controls are great and it’s just as strategic as the LoL.

25,App Store,"I got really into this game, like REALLY into it, and I was meeting and playing with a lot of really fun people. After several months of good times Riot implemented a patch that took away 'All-Chat.' 
     Why? My interpretation of the patch notes was that some players couldn't control their emotions and would start fights with their own teammates and/or the enemy team. That being said; there is a convenient 'mute-button' next to each individual player that can be toggled at any time during the game. On top of that you also have the ability to toggle 'All-Chat' in the settings. 
      Anytime I play this game now it honestly feels so  empty and disconnected. I almost never see anyone using the chat system anymore; just from taking away the ability to communicate with the enemy team. 
     Now I realize the game is not designed to also be a social platform, it's designed to be a competitive game, but couldn't there be a compromise? Couldn't we keep 'All-Chat' in normal games and take it out for ranked? 
   Anyway, Riot tried to remove all-chat on their desktop version of the game but the community strongly rejected that idea. Wild Rift unfortunately doesn't yet have a strong enough community to fight back the removal so Riot got away with it.",2,League of Meh,,2023-02-06 16:12:51,,

I’ve dumped hundreds of hours into this mobile game… maybe thousands, and it’s a joy.  I have only spent money on a few cosmetic options.  There is absolutely no pay to win component.  You’re given enough of the f2p currency you acquire from just playing to get a bunch of free champions at the start and give yourself more than enough options to do well.  Much of the time, new champs are simply given to you if you do basic challenge missions during the launch week.  And the balance in this game, while not perfect, is not set up so that new champs are S tier to the point where it’s literally impossible to win against them.

Which I suppose it apart of the game, but it gets unfair and boring when one team is absolutely destroying. That is worse when we have afk people. Still a fun game. Idk why people are complaining. It does it’s job being a fun game for mobile.

EDIT. I haven’t noticed many of the issues presented in many reviews. So I will have to get a taste of them before I say something about that.
Second is, while in a game, you can’t leave or go without being punished, which is good, but if while being punished for being afk one could still play vs ai, it would be nice because for the next hour or so i have to go play or do something else.

Somehow it runs very well. If you were wanting to learn how to play league but don’t have the time for it, this my friend, is the perfect app for you.

Compared to League PC, Wild Rift is much more preferable. There’s definitely more content and it’s more competitive on PC but everything on PC just looks horrible. From the walk animation to the champion models themselves; even the map looks like it’s from 2010. 

There are a few cons that I would like to point out which mainly centers around the player base themselves. Simply put, the lower you are, the more trolls and toxic people you get as teammates and that can be very annoying. Even though I am in Grandmasters, this happens often as well.

Some of the champs very underwhelming comparing to their pc counter parts. For exp when you play Camille her true damage from her q is not nearly as much compared to pc and her e range is so much smaller. There’s many other champs that are like this. I understand they need to change certain champs to fit the game, but when playing the champ it just feels different and unfun. Another complaint that I have is the items are different compared to the pc. All the mythic items have not been added to the game yet and I personally really like all the new items from s11 league.

43,App Store,"This game has amazing graphics, high-intensity mechanics and interesting characters and was once a favorite of mine when Season 2 came out. However, it has become an absolute mess of a game after the past few seasons. New champions with ridiculous abilities continue to appear without any proper balancing and older champions have received no meaningful buffs whatsoever. And to top all of it off, the matchmaking system in this game is by far the worst I have ever experienced in this genre of the game. You can be repeatedly matched with people who troll or afk every game while the other team seems perfectly fine. The penalty system in this game is completely useless and enforces nothing against repeat offenders and frankly you will find yourself doubting whether you have actually improved at all because of how many times you can lose in a single session. Finally, the customer support provided by Riot is quite mediocre. At times they answer questions with proper explanations and make an effort to create improvements in the game but at other times, they simply ignore you and say random things that neither help nor make sense.

I have followed their progress since 2012 and I have to say they don’t ever miss a beat when it comes to making amazing development, mechanics and providing their audience with adventure no matter where they are. From the Blitzcrank grab game back in 2015 to the several top notch games on mobile today, Wild Rift has got to be the best. Not only did they learn from mobile MOBA predecessors like Vainglory, they also added their own flair from League of Legends PC. Ensuring the additions of favorite champs with more of the cast to come and an easy to use interface, I’m sure those that give below a 4 star are just the ported over toxic community that had too high of expectations and that their favorite champion (base Urgot) hasn’t been put in.

After waiting for about 2 years without playing league of legend, I am now so happy to finally play my only favorite game of all time. And this version of league of legend is perfect. Even for an early stage of the game I am stunned. A super smooth 60 FPS, beautiful graphics (just like pc version), super easy controls and very responsive, it even have few more amazing features that even the pc version doesn’t have. I will put money in this mobile game for the first time ever (I never thought I would put money on any mobile game ever but here I am now! ) thank you so much riot game, you are making me the happiest man on earth when i am so far from my home country and my friends (and my league of legend but now I have wild rift so it doesn’t matter anymore lol) .

46,App Store,"When it comes to mobile games this has so many great things going for it. It feels and plays a lot like the pc LoL. When I’m on the go it’s a great for a quick game here or there. However, ranked is just plan horrendous. The matchmaking is terrible. When I have repeated games of teammates who go 0/12, 0/9 etc or who are afk and get “a penalty” it just ruins the experience. There has to be a better way to filter out players who are not attempting to play as a team or just plan don’t play in a match. Force afkers and throwers to match up with other griefers. It can’t be that difficult. Nothing can be a buzz kill like a thrower…that is unless you get multiple games in a row with them. Fix it.

Edit: 
I decided to give wild rift a second shot after watching arcane. Been playing for about a month.  This season of ranked was going well until I switched roles and started winning a ton.  Improved my rank from gold 1 to plat 2 very quickly.  It seems like the game noticed my above average play and has penalized me by giving me bad teammates or trolls for 12 games in a row.  Literally 2-12 and my winning % now dropped to 50%.  It’s so frustrating.

I am having difficulties ranking up because of afk and intentional feeding. Ever since I started playing ranked, it’s been one loss and one Win. It gets frustrating because you aren’t going anywhere. I believe that developers should add more shield or give more shield to players when ranking down. It is annoying that you are playing so hard and you get crapped over by one person on the team. I understand that that everyone is here to play for fun but many players do not show good sportsmanship and I hope lol can find ways to rectify this problem.

I abandon three matches in a week, and i have a two hour ban i have to log in to activate. Lets say i have to do something so I am forced to abandon my match. Three hours later, i log back in to a screen that says ive been banned for 20 minutes. Ok. I do it again, only for an hour to be added every time i abandon in 7 DAYS! It is applied to every gamemode, even AI matches. I dont play ARAM, so I dont know if this is the case there. I am now sitting here with nothing to do because i had to go three times in one week. It is stupid, please make a new system. Otherwise, the gameplay is excellent along with the brilliant event systems and how it is the perfect amount of grinding for each hero.

49,App Store,"The game is awesome and so much fun to play. I think Riot really put the time and love in on this one. I’m happy they took their time and made sure they had something special before they released it. I see some people complaining about the controls however I haven’t run into any issues and think they work great and suit a mobile game great. In a lot of ways I prefer this game to the PC version of league, I think the matches are more intense and move quicker. The smaller number of champions is refreshing and makes for more balanced and approachable gameplay in my opinion. 

The only thing I would recommend at this time is controller support. I think the touch controls are great but adding a controller would really be appreciated by those who use them for other ios games, and especially those playing on an ipad. Since Wild Rift was supposed to be the same game on mobile and consoles controller support would definitely be conducive to this.

50,App Store,"5 stars because it looks and feels better than any other mobile game out there but it has its issues. #1 - no afk protection. Its essential to making the game feel fair. 10-30% of my games on a daily basis are lost to afk or trolling teammates that don’t get punished properly. Meanwhile the chat ban starts at 68 hours. That’s how long an afk ban should be if there’s no afk protection. Way too long for a chat restriction, flame is mean/annoying while going afk/inting ruins the enjoyment of the game for everyone. So PUNISH the players actually ruining the game please. #2 - Lee sin. #3 - wild pass stops.  There should be unlimited rewards even if it’s just blue essence IMO  #4 - lp gain/loss should just be even no? It’s kinda infuriating to win 1 lose 1 and actually be lower lp that you started especially when that loss is to an intinf player that can just queue up again

51,App Store,I picked this up after playing on PC for years. One thing I love about this game is how fast the games are. I’m the kind of guy that likes to play every single champ. In pc league of legends it seems to take hours and hours to really lock in how a champ works. Say for instance you accidentally throw your first game with a new champ. Instead of waiting 30 to 40 mins to try again wild rift makes it 10-15. I’ve found myself learning champs in wild rift Rand taking that knowledge into league of legends. It’s almost like a training ground for your micro play. Also if you get into the competitive aspect of the game your macro will be tested as well. You have to make your decisions way faster and the effect of your decisions is made clear much sooner in wild rift than it is in your regular game of league. I highly recommend playing wild rift if you’re new or just need some decent practice. Any PC gamer that plays this and doesn’t find the value in it is missing out.,5,Job well done,,2021-06-02 16:37:55,,

 The ranked systems LOADED TO THE BRIM. With boosters win traders hackers dcers hard feeders account swappers or the ladder.  
Lemme explain.  The game used to be better cause you had bronze and silver feeders and boosters in the bottom of the barrel ( where they belong ).  Now as a plat / emerald.  I play ranked and get people dragging bronze and silver low Ello feeders who think they are better then BRONZE. The game used to be fair balanced and aside from feeders the worst is the cheating.  Mostly damage amps defense amps ward hacks/ sight hacks and BOT FARMERS. If you don’t get those ( 7/10 games this year.) you have duos bringing first timers in ranked cause it’s not protected with a limit or min requirement. So you’ll be emerald - diamond matched against a full emerald team and some douche brings there bronze lvl 10-20 buddy.  The matchups are normally 15-30* ranked division difference and you get the shafted end 9/10.  The game needs to bang harder also and look into better anti cheats.  I shouldn’t see bots almost every night. I rarely play 6-10 games a night or even a week if I’m lucky . That’s TO MUCH. For a game like leagues.  Do better disgraceful",1,God awful for ranked.

53,App Store,"Now, I'll start off by saying that the PC and Mobile version [cannot] be compared.  Why?  Because they are two completely different platforms with communities that look for different aspects and are accustomed to different types of controls.

Wild Rift is basically a bite-sized version of PC League that includes the major parts of the game (minions, turret AI, economy, and roles).  It's more suitable for players that want to play this game to kill a little bit of time and not have to play a whole full-fledged battle.  The devs did a good job at simplifying stuff by desaturating the amount of detail on item effects.  If makes it easier for players to learn the game and to make it feel less overwhelming.

The only thing I love about this game is its faithfulness to the original and its platform-appropriate adaptation.

The only thing I don't like is how the support role has a lack of presence.  In the time I have played this game, I have not sensed a support player ever.  They felt like dead weight that just followed the team, which didn't seem like it helped or punished anyone at all.  If the PvP mechanics of Wild Rift were at least a bit more similar to League PC (in terms of healing and slowing), maybe it would help the Support role feel more valuable.  Otherwise, we could run two ADCs and disregard Supp.

The reason why I am giving this five stars is because of how the controls and the goal of the game were adapted well.",5,For those coming drom LoL PC,,2021-04-30 18:28:09,,

Recently I just played a game where one of my teammates banned my pre picked champ and was completely throwing and feeding throughout the match. They never helped their duo and they ran away from team fights plus they did not help when asked. Because of this one person it ended up causing me and 3 other people to lose a match which is so unfair. They were blatantly griefing and no matter how much I report them NOTHING HAPPENS. What? They get warnings? Can’t play a couple games? That’s not a worthy penalty. They literally ruined the game and made it less fun. It’s frustrating how these players get away with it so often to the point where I give up reporting all together.

55,App Store,"Overall the game is satisfying to play. The controls are straightforward, itemization is easy, and the game is condensed enough to be fit for mobile without it feeling watered down. Matchmaking, however, needs fixing and can make not only ranked but normal games unfair and unpleasant. Grandmasters can play in lobbies with silver players in norms and ARAM- that should never happen, even late at night. Every time this happens, the game’s outcome depends entirely on whether the master+ player wants to try. As for ranked, climbing on low ranked accounts can be so difficult it’s not fun anymore. I am low platinum matched with emerald/diamond players every match, which makes me not want to keep playing to reach the rank the game thinks I should be in. To climb I either need to consistently beat players better than me or throw matches until I’m back with people in my rank. Let me play with people near my skill level in unranked matches and don’t put me in ranked lobbies where I’m 2 ranks below everybody else.",4,Matchmaking needs fixing,,2021-12-04 00:03:09,,

As anyone could guess they are the reason I dropped out of Diamond because every loss is -15 lp and every win is 10. I strive to be the best and low elo players only hold me back when I would rather be playing with players better then me to become better. I also dislike how people can abuse the 5 player system in ranked when it’s called “Solo/Duo.” Some players can get free wins by doing the bare minimum because their friends can just carry them. Ranked is suppose to make you in particular a better player. I soloed 85% of my games to Diamond and find it frustrating always playing against 5 mans who just abuse the ranked system.

62,App Store,"Wild Rift is the next evolution for League of Legends, an upgraded engine, upgraded models, quicker games and as the title implies a “Wild Rift”. 
The map is varied and randomized allowing for on the fly gameplay changes. 

For anyone saying the touch screen combat is clunky I have to disagree, once I got used to the controls I was stomping on people. Being able to run while autoing and the ability to quick cast on character direction/placement allows for some quick twitch reactions that main client just doesn't allow and makes escapes much more possible and reliable rather than having to just give up and let the enemy team kill you because you’re too slow. 

The only cons I have with Wild Rift is that there’s a lack of item variety, having more active items like galeforce or zz’rot would allow strategy and gameplay to breath and make choices more important. I also think Runes would be better if they were the full system from main game rather than the weird mixed tier system currently implemented, not being able to use Dark Harvest on Jhin is no fun, if I’m mobbing the enemy I should be able to have a high risk high reward rune that supports my play style if I’m doing good. If you could Riot, please add some modern client features such as Legendary items, potions, additional runes and more boot options.

I keep getting paired with trash players who intentionally feed and often time it’s the same player after I reported it. For instance player “pipluppiplup” literally said he’s going to troll when game started and then proceeded to run into the towers in a rank match. Next game I get paired with this player again and he proceeds to do it again. Player “Elmigue97” decided he didn’t want to jungle last second and instead lane with adc and support as akali. He then comes down to my lane where I am nasus and then proceeds to take my creep then goes back to base or into the tower. It’s honestly pretty annoying when players like this are ruining the game. The reporting system isn’t working I think. People going afk because it is a mobile game so I guess penalties are not severe. CONCLUSION.

The year is 2023 and Riot Game enforce this arcade matchmaking system that artificially match you up with bad players so you are kept at a 50% win rate. This level of manipulation only serves to kill the competitive spirit of anyone who plays for rank.

If you are match up with a bad teammate or teammates you will waist all of that time for nothing. You will drop in rank and waist your time.

70,App Store,"League of Legends: Wild Rift is a poor parody of the traditional PC game. The mobile adaptation features a simplified version that seems to be appealing to the younger and more casual audience to draw in more players to the franchise, which is fine, but the game itself is very dumbed down. For existing fans you’ll have to slog through a tutorial section, that although can be partially skipped, forces you to play a full scale game against A.I. opponents which is just a waste of time. Additionally, the control scheme the developers have implemented is very unwieldy and clunky to try and use, so it compensates for that with auto-aim mechanics that significantly lower the amount of skill players require to succeed, handholding the player to give them an artificial feeling of success when the game did all the work for them. This game could seriously benefit from changing the controls to something similar to what is seen in Vainglory, which utilizes touch controls in a much simpler and more effective way, with far less clutter on the screen. The lack of effort on delivering even half the quality and care as the traditional game comes off as just a cash grab, and is sad to see in such a sorry state.",1,Just Play the Real Game,,2021-03-29 02:12:39,"{'id': 21971970, 'body': 'Please reach out to us with a ticket at https://support-wildrift.riotgames.com/ and we can figure out what happened!', 'modified': '2021-03-31T13:04:35Z'}",

The first year and a half of having this game was great (I don’t own a pc anymore so having league again meant alot) but the matchmaking in ranked and normals makes games so one sided it’s not even fun to play anymore.

I don’t know if that is too fast for getting gold without farming at all. It’s a flaw because players can easily level up and win, and it’s more fun if players are able to work for theirs skills and lvl up. Rather than easily getting what you want and then just win just like that. For short it’s too easy to get your skills. In addition, the “Pinging” are like too complex, it would be easier if there’s just like an exclamation point on the bottom of the map and alert your team, rather having 4 or 3 options to drag your finger to alert or signal.

I’ve played WR since it’s release and it’s easy to differentiate between a new player and an AI. The bots will run down the lane and hard int, move in notably odd patterns, miss every single skill shot by a mile, roam to any lane at any time to int there, 0 communication. It’s especially rampant in unranked, but still very common in ranked (granted I can’t speak on anything that above plat 2 but bots shouldn’t be that high anyways). Ruins the fun of winning when it’s just stomping the other team that happened to get more bots than you. Waste of time to lose when you’re on the team with mostly bots and their team is 20-0 in the first 10min with all objectives.

I understand that every player has a choice when it comes to choosing heroes, but it is fundamentally crucial that this hero at least fits their lane or role somewhat. For example mage/spellcasters as a jungle? It is Incredibly hard to get a good game from that composition.

89,App Store,"League of Legends: Wild Rift is a mobile adaptation of the PC League of Legends. Wild Rift is a relatively accurate representation of the Summoners Rift which many of us have come to know and love. This game is literally packed with potential for breaking the mobile MOBA competitive scene into mainstream, here’s my current pros and cons.

PROS:
1. Accurate representation of League of Legends.

2. Faster gameplay for those not wanting to sink too much of your time into a single game.

3. Beautiful visuals, better than the PC version in my opinion.

4. Ranked system is much more fair compared to PC version, less likely to get hard stuck in divisions you don’t belong in.

5. Unique Wild Rift items, many of the new items Wild Rift introduced are brilliant and should be in the PC version.

CONS:

1. Lack of champion pool, this is only a current issue and will be worked on in due time.

2. Unbalanced characters, suffers from the same issue as PC League of Legends where some characters are a bit overpowered and others seem to be entirely forgotten about.

3. Lack of draft mode in normals.... Anyone who dislikes blind pick basically has no choice but to play ranked.

Overall I give this adaptation a 4 of 5 stars for being such a strong MOBA experience despite it’s current beta stage. Some small tweaks in needed places will give the extra needed boost to be a 5 star mobile title.",4,Incredible Potential!,,2021-05-17 18:16:26,,
90,App Store,This game is super fun and gets my heart pumping. It’s like a real sport. However it is a team game and it is super frustrating to play ranked solo because of bad teammates. I’ve been playing this game on and off for 5+ years on computer and now mobile. Unfortunately for Riot they have not found the balance between rewarding good players and punishing bad ones. Just today I’ve been playing for six hours straight and have not moved up more than two mark points. I’ve been saved over and over again by my mark loss points thankfully! But it’s so frustrating to grind all day and play really well to get nowhere! I’ve gotten 8 SVPs and have been placed on awful teams that have barely made it to platinum before. I’ve been up in diamond and honestly should be back there now. However it’s hard to move up when it’s an afk then a newbie who really cannot play well. Or players who have zero game IQ.

You cant tell me that a person of sane mind can die 10 times in first 5 mins of the game while being in grand master/master tier. Which is happening every single game. This is either win trading or extremely toxic people who should be banned/flagged. This can easily be fixed by increasing punishment for bad behavior, or queueing toxic people with toxic people.

No need for a balanced team because the good players get really discouraged from grinding rank when they get constantly afk’s or even bad teammates who purposefully try to loose games because of their bad experience. I’d say a really simple solution to this problem is match players based on hero mastery instead of rank or anything else.

I can’t believe how smooth the creators made this game.

The only real gripe I have with the game is the ping in-game. The server traffic get’s SO busy often, to the point where players would D/C or even AFK. 
Everything about Wild Rift is amazing— the same yet different game. If this server connection thing was improved, it would be solid. Most MOBAs suffer from this connection thing, so I don’t blame the creators.

96,App Store,"The game overall feels very similar to it's main PC counterpart, however, they did take liberties to change the game for mobile. 

That being said, if you are coming to this from LoL like I am, you may have to adjust to using a touch screen to direct every movement, spell, and auto attack. If you also use unlocked camera often on PC, WR only has locked camera with a mini map you can 'check' on. 

The controls feel responsive. (with a good internet connection) Some spells have added range and effects to emphasize what they do. Minions will tell you they can be executed at a certain health threshold. All the champions I've played or played against feel balanced and effective for what they do. There's also a lot of communication pings. Perhaps too much.

The summoners rift ping lady screams. A lot. In addition, you have the power to spam her voice. I do not use this power gently, and never hesitate to spam ping ""RE-RE-RETREAT!"" to someone that cannot understand I called ""Baron Lane."" 

Which brings me to my biggest complaint, a lack of verbal acknowledgment from teammates in PVP or even Ranked.

I’ve been waiting for a great MOBA mobile experience for a long time and the only games that ever came close was VainGlory and Arena of Valor. I’m not mentioning Mobile Legends because it has stolen a lot from League and yes AOV has too but it’s owed by the same company. No disrespect to the people who play Mobile Legends.. but this is the real deal. This is the only MOBA I need on my phone and the only thing that could come close to stealing my heart is a Smite Mobile version and sadly that will probably never happen.

That takes no effort on their part to find those disconnected, but to see a game and punish players who ruin it for everyone else, it’s too much work apparently. I’ve come across dozens of players on this platform who all say the same thing and it makes ranked games unfavorable knowing that if someone feeds on purpose nothing will happen to them. I’ve also had a few games where in “all-chat” racial slurs are used but again Riot has no response if you report it.

I understand at the end of the day, Riot is making money. However, if they continue to ignore their community handing out actual helpful solutions to every problem of theirs, they WILL lose their community. Maybe not today, but a person can only devote so many hours to a video game that doesn’t devote an ounce of effort back. It’s a shame because this game can be really enjoyable when a team is full of competent players, whether we win or lose, at least we try.

Things out of Riots control though are the fact that the player base with this actually has found a way to get more unintelligent than the PC version.

First, they took away any kind of system where older ones cost less, and brought them all up to the same price of blue crystals. Now, if that wasn’t bad enough, ALL champions require additional currency that you MUST PAY FOR to own that champion. Step by step it’s becoming not just a pay to win, but a pay to play.

You lack a sense of morals when it comes to games.

Platinum rank is toxic as all and riot loves to keep people there and team them up with bad players who get through the easyness of gold.

A way they could maybe fix this is to rank you up based on a points system and your own performance since there’s already a feature to see what percentage of a certain champion you did better than after each ranked game. Another thing that can make ranked super annoying is that when teammates disconnect for THE ENTIRE GAME making it a 4v5, it still counts as a loss. A way to fix this is to have that game not count as a loss while the winning team has it still count as a win but get no ranked fortitude from it.

Besides, most of the toxicity comes from our teammates rather than the enemy’s. All-chat doesn’t give us bad experience to the game, removing COMPLETELY does though. Now, we are not able to taunt or have a fun conversation with the enemy team making us unable to identify whether or not they have a good personality.

I look in settings and there is no reason why.  I have to then try to “deselect” the champ that somehow got targeted and try to select the champ I should already have killed which may be too late already.

2. What if there was a tournament where everybody puts in 100+ crystals and it is a free for all or team fight where the winner gets all the crystals or the team gets an equal amount if crystals (the winner would be guaranteed to get 20% more than they put in)

During rank up matches why are lvl 12s getting recruited with lvl 50s and 100s so on? Im lvl 34 but I WAS already emerald 4 about to hit 3 because I grind so hard but I get stuck with “noobs”. I have 10 straight losses which got me demoted to platinum because I havent gotten recruited with any higher ranks. The reason this is a problem is because every noob player is picking characters that dont even correspond to their lane so we dont have tanks, healers etc just a team full of gun characters against a full on blown tank team. Two other complaints I have is it takes wayyyy to long to even get a character Ive counted it takes about two weeks even you login everyday.

I mean it’s normal for game designer that builds up this kinda things to make gamer addicted to the game. But, it just looks way too obvious for this game…. To me, I felt like this company loses some original enthusiasm when making this game. If you play A LOT, you’ll have a good winning rate. You’ll be paired with normal people. This is how this game works cuz they want you to play A LOT. But if you just play like two rounds per one or two days, you’ll have pretty bad winning rate not because you’re bad at this game, but the system would pair you with AIs who are not even collaborating at all.

It’s frustrating to try and communicate with your teammates when they speak another language. Secondly, with it being a mobile game, a lot of times even in ranked, players don’t play the game how it’s supposed to be played. Ex. I play mid lane and had to deal with a mundo and ahri in the mid lane. It makes any kind of actually gameplay frustrating and aggravating.

First, moving champions on a touch screen actually making the action of moving more accurate and smooth. It’s easier to have to keep clicking my mouse very quickly to move them around on pc.

Second, I like the faster pace of the game. Each game could run as fast as 10 minutes, and a long game doesn’t go over 30 minutes because of its simplified map (but the game is as fun). I remember I used to have some 50+ minutes game when I played it on PC and it was very tiring.

Third, I like the variety of events it has. It updates it’s events frequently and it has fun and useful rewards.

Last but not least, kind of related to my first point, when a champion is moving on the screen, the screen automatically move with it so my champion is always at the center of the screen. This is a life saver as I don’t have to drag my mouse to move my screen around like what I did on the pc version.

In rank there’s no bans, if there’s an overpowered hero you better hope to get it otherwise you can’t stop them from doing so.

A duplication of the PC part as it is, it’s definitely more complicated when compared to other games. But I think the overall experience is perfect. One thing I do feel kind of in need for improvement is the control of performing basic attack, the manipulation is kind of weird and different from other existing games. When you are in a team war and you want to attack someone nearby, it sometimes does not react. And it looks not smooth when you move and do basic attack simultaneously.

What this game has going on for it is great, however, it should take into account that it is still a mobile game, and it will always be one.

The controls are nice, and lend themselves to the versatile skills of the many characters, allowing you to quickly and easily cast character abilities, and not favoring a specific style of champion. 

I for one will not sit on my phone for 45+mins to play a match of League.

And some matchmaking issues like there are people who are waaaay lower than the ranks they are playing with. I saw unranked playing with a diamond ranked in RANKED. 
Oh and one other thing can you work more on ability interactions? I will give u and example (if you stun lux when she is using ult. She will ult anyway :/) these kind of interactions.

Advice: add another option for controlling pls like VAINGLORY its controlls were waay easier and smoother than joystick type. In teamfights you could use what to do easier and faster u can do it like this too but touch control was waaay faster.

Proposal: can u stop randomly adding champs to wild rift? Ask the players what to add next. Its not like you are gonna make a new champ you are just adding them from LEAGUE OF LEGENDS with a few differences.
You can say “what do you want to see next” and ask the players to choose champions from pc version of LOL.

One thing I noticed though is that the character selection phase (right before the game starts) is GOD AWFUL. Although this flaw isn't enough to ruin the game, it is definitely something that needs some work. 

If you don't already know, when selecting what characters you and your teammates will play as, they're all sectioned off into their respective roles so that you'll know what your characters'role is. Sounds great right? Well there's just one small problem. UNLESS you are an experienced League of Legends player, and you know the role of every character, you will NOT know what role you teammates are playing. When teammates pick their character, you are not told their role unless that specific player says ""I'll jungle"" or something like that. 

This flaw makes the game very unfriendly to beginners because they aren't told what role is needed until all other teammates choose theirs.

Do this enough times, and you get a ban that increases each time, and let me tell you, it doesn’t take much for the ban to kick in. Having to wait over an hour to re queue just makes me want to uninstall. I agree there should be some sort of punishment for leaving game/AFK, especially in PvP. But as far as vs AI is concerned, you need to adjust the parameters. It’s a bit too extreme in my opinion. End rant.",3,Ease up on the banhammer,,2021-04-14 23:26:06,,
157,App Store,"This game is amazing! Glad that Riot was able to make League of Leagends into a mobile version that is fast paced. It includes the ability to play with friends, meet and add new friends. It has an in-game voice chat and reporting system for offensive players, cheaters, and trolls. Boasts amazing artwork and graphics, wonderful music, and even better lore. All of the actual real world money spent on the game is either cosmetic or for champions. As you play the game, you earn “blue motes” a free to play currency that anyone can use to buy champions. Matchmaking is based on an MMR system so that you do play against players of the same caliber. I can’t say enough about this game!

158,App Store,"While the graphics and characters are spot on with their desktop counterparts, the game play suffers from some hardcore oversimplification that makes it entirely too easy to get stomped by easy to play champs. Seems like every match has a Vayne and/or Yi who just runs rampant and ruins the experience for all the other players. Then there’s the leaver penalty - Riot needs to understand this is a MOBILE game, and sometimes people have to put their phone down. Granted if it becomes excessive it should be discouraged, but setting your phone down to deal with a real life issue should not be penalized by a 150 second matchmaking delay for PAYING CUSTOMERS. Extremely disappointing. That doesn’t make me want to avoid the matchmaking penalty, it just makes me want to avoid spending money on this app. If I had time to focus 100% on the game, I’d be playing the desktop version anyway.",2,Terrible adaptation,,2023-01-26 19:06:41,,

In comparison a person with 2000 games with the rank of Edmiral is matched up on the same team with someone who has 300 games. The disparity is, is the game knowledge for the person with 300 games. And that also reflects in a game experience. Individuals with 300 games are still not map aware and are still learning champions. The whole ranking system is broken to the point that is almost unplayable. We expect individuals to play their best. But yet play the worst they could ever play. AFK - I’m not sure if this is a connection issue or an issue with the end-user. But the make up is not as fluid as it should be. A person can play a game for 10 minutes and all of a sudden another player decides to go AFK. At that point the only thing you’re going to get out of Wild Rift is fortitude.

That happening one or two games is fine, but there are times we’re I’ll have a streak of five or more lobbies just like that. Makes you want to uninstall when you see that happening.

Also, this game is still in BETA, there is and will be issues. The more people stress test the servers and help spot issues, the better and more stable the game will become.

You need support and have to give support to not only win the battle, but to also have an enjoyable time. People just leave you in battle and go off and attack things in different areas that aren’t even required for the event or battle.

I think they did a good job adapting the game,but movement is way harder than on pc which is weird since on pc that only needs the mouse phones are touchscreen. But overall it’s a decent mobile adaptation, considering how crappy mobile games can usually be. But unfortunately I do not see that other game that is a part of league of legends, that is like a board game i can’t remember what it’s called.

But I am disappointed by two things. 
1. At first I thought this was a major flaw but I sorta understand it. You can’t cross-platform with pc! I thought it would be great to play with my friends on their PCs from anywhere on my mobile device, I thought this could be really awesome but I guess they don’t want that.
The worst thing is that Champion unlocks and character skins  do not transfer over.

The game has a nice simplicity about it that makes it easier for non pc players to enjoy. I would say it’s perfect for people who want to get in to league. The things that could be done to fix the game are listed below:

-Have events more often with limited prizes that are worth grinding for.

-Fix matchmaking (this is almost universal with all games, does not mean we like playing with bronze players while in platinum).

-Release more legends!

-Reward the players with decent loot and something to play for!

First and foremost, the game is extremely balanced with robust characters. However, one thing that I find lacking is the amount of competitiveness.

Characters die too fast while items that gives magic resist and armor provide less survivability. Tanks such as Mundo are the only ones that can fully utilize equipments like the tank item that increases healing. Not only that, healing or life steal are nonexistent.

This makes it very easy to the point where difficult champions like Katarina, Zed, and Yasuo can just absolutely mash their buttons and almost always hit their target. Vainglory’s system leaves more room for skill, less clutter, and it just feels so much better.

Someone can SOLO the entire team. Buuutttt LOL is extremely balanced. These games take so much longer because it takes a team to win the game. The mechanics can’t be matched.

There needs to be a better training experience so that people take the roles they get and stop force filling because they can’t or refuse to do the role they’re given. It isn’t fair that I get forced to lose because I can win lane or do my role as best I can while the support picks Zed and runs it down trying for kills and repeatedly dies.

Sometimes when I move my character will go the opposite way or go slightly off course. In one game I played my game was really buggy. The game would freeze and a thing came up saying game data loading. During that game the movement issues were more severe, and my character would sometimes clip through walls.

No one follows the roles even though it’s already preset as their strongest roles. And people like DarkRaven should never ever be allowed to play games like this ever. The amount of negativity and toxicity from him just put me off completely from this game. 

People like him should be completely blocked off from any game owned by this company. It just very off putting and just messes up with the whole experience. Been a fan but right now all I can say is this should be deleted off apps store until the developers can come up with a better control over how the community should be. 

Great game, big potential but sad about how it’s refereed. There should be a mental psychology test for each new account. The game characters and their speeds are quite slow too and it feels like you have to break the screen to just move your character to a certain fight area even with added speed.

198,App Store,"My problems are twofold: ranked matchmaking and toxicity?

In matchmaking, why do you even bother to ask what role you want to play when the percent chance you actually get it is so low. Why force players in RANKED who choose to specialize in a particular role to play things they don’t want to or are not good at which severely increasing the chances of you losing. Theres not a player in sight that wouldnt mind waiting a bit longer if it meant they always got the role they want in a given match.

While I’m at it, why does Riot continue to penalize people in ranked a loss when people go afk for extended periods in a match? A 4 v 5 matchup in most cases is a guaranteed loss. Why should everyone have to suffer for it? Thats not fair at all.

Now, the toxicity in this game has not improved at all. My friends and I left the PC version because of this and are about to do the same with mobile. Reporting legitimately bad behavior like threats or hacking does nothing. Instead, you get penalized time off of your play for reasons that aren’t within your control like a lapse in your connection.

I’m giving it a star cause I love the gameplay. However, the way the game’s handled is disappointing. The focus seems to be more on cashing in with fancy visuals than actual gameplay.",1,The song remains the same. Great game marred by disappointments.,,2021-05-29 05:06:17,,

Once that issue gets fixed I think I’ll bump the review up to a 5/5 as the game is very enjoyable! As a dumb casual I would personally like more “for fun” game modes to be added since I know stuff like mirror mode exists on the PC version.

Each game takes forever, and has often been decided before the match even begins by MM. you’ll often find yourself 6 min in, and their Kayle is 3/0. There simply isn’t a good reason to keep playing, and it’s frustrating to know that you’ve consigned another 20min of your life to playing it out.
There is a surrender option for games that have been decided, but it’s woefully underused. 2/5 players can hold the other three hostage in a completely lost game.

Is it any wonder that players are toxic when they realize a bad play means they’re spending the rest of their available play time going through the motions and getting one shot by fed opponents? 

The surrender threshold needs to be lowered, maybe dynamically with the scoreboard. If 2/5 want out when the score is 2/18 then they should be allowed out. 

This would have the added effect of competitively minded players needing to watch out and protect their team morale. If you actually need their votes to keep playing, you won’t be flaming them",3,Not enough “game” for the time,,2023-07-22 15:55:45,,

some improvements that i think would be nice:
-optimize the targeting options to not cancel an auto midway 
-allow the use of abilities while auto-pathing somewhere (e.g., i have pathed to top lane and want to use a speed-up ability to get there). currently, this is not possible and the character stops moving if they use an ability while auto pathing.
-in targeting options, separate minions and champions for the options of ""Target by Lowest Health (Absolute)"" and ""Target by Lowest Percentage Health""; I've missed a couple of minions due to the auto target honing on the half health cannon even though there are casters about to die.

All it does is trash the stats of people playing ranked and absolutely destroys the thought of skill-based ranked play. I would very gladly wait additional time in the queue over the possibility of getting teammates who simply are going to destroy my stats, which I have taken a lot of time and energy into maintaining.

They are penalized but it still ruins the match for other players when 20% or more of the team is ineffectual because of the AFK. In ranked mode, this is pretty much a guaranteed loss for the other players.

- sometimes during a match the audio gets muted abruptly and that freezes the screen where players give a like to other teammates at the end of the match, therefore gives us no choice but to reset the app.

- when you transition from app to app for more than few minutes, wild rift automatically logs you out, but logs back in if you exit the app and open again or you can just log back in.

- Also the circular controller on the left bottom side of the screen is doesn’t work precisely and it feels kinda hard to go to directions you wanna go.

- also it would be nice if 2D animations of the champions were high quality. (Maybe it’s very pixelated only on bigger screens because I use iPad)

Updates on the game have been good and the challenges and stuff you can get just from playing is nice as well. I all around like this game and the only reason I’m not giving it five starts is 1. Because they took ultra rapid fire away :,( and 2. Sometimes matchmaking isn’t the greatest. Especially with a lot of afk players. I think penalty for afk behavior should have more consequences.

Team composition matters in this game unlike some of the other apps. Experience some lag occasionally even playing on a new iPhone so must have a good phone to play this. One thing I think could be improved would be if on your friends list it shows which position / lane the friend prefers so that when inviting friends to play in ranked you know who to invite by which position you need filled.

Yup doesn’t that sound pretty fair. If you’re low health and shred him it won’t matter because he will not die and kill you instead. Isn’t that rewarding for being better.

So this person would be in platinum and would be climbing with a 50% win rate and having atleast 8 deaths a game.

It would also be nice to pick the items you want to build while in the game so you can control suggested purchases. Right now you set the items you want before a game (or use the default) and if you decide you need to build something different the shop would suggest a 1050 gold purchase instead of the 500gold purchase to finish an item just because you’re building different from the preset build.

So I understand when people say there’s no real skill in rift and it’s all auto attacks and 1v5 penta kills all around and such. I get it this game is nothing compared to league. But it’s not league it’s wild rift. It’s a way to play the game during your 30min break. While being bored at a party wanting only to be home playing league. Don’t bag on it for the fact that it’s not league. And except it for what it is. A way to play away from home and from the convenience of your phone.,5,Bad reviews,,2021-06-02 18:28:43,,

Then after a while it starts banning you for extremely long times. And on top of all that, the player support never answers you. Ever. You email them then they ask for you to put Ina ticket. Then you respond and say you sent the ticket, and it asks for you to put in a ticket, so on. And finally if they ever answer they just say, “sorry, that looks like a you problem” ie.

This is a lot more fun, and I love being able to play games almost anywhere on phone or tablet. Since SEMC abandoned their amazing game VainGlory last year to focus on something new and stupid, this is by far the best MOBA on mobile. 

I really enjoy that this doesn’t feel like a pay-to-win game. You can spend real money on cosmetic stuff, and to unlock heroes faster, but you can honestly earn enough of the free in-game currency just by playing that you can buy almost any hero you want with just a few days of very casual play, so you don’t need to spend any money to have a lot of fun.

My main gripes:
1. Virtual joysticks work okay, but I’d honestly prefer tap controls like VainGlory used to have.

I love how fast pace this is with increased xp and spawn time for minions (5-25min games.) If you’re in a bad game being griefed or taken hostage usually they go by fast so it’s not as hurtful as the pc toxicity. Not all the champs are in but I’m ok with that as they cover most of the popular/easy to play champs. The only downfall I’d say is ranked is really easy to climb compared to pc.

How is it exactly my fault when I’m unable to play? I’m punished for leaving when I have no choice but to leave. I don’t like these warnings. It’s unfair for people who need to quit to prioritize real life things. I closed the game in order to go inside a store that I had no choice but to go, and when I opened the app, I had the warning.

I used to play Vainglory back when it was big and it was the game that got me into mobas, therefore I love their controls.

It’s okay, people are human. Just be ready to lose as much as you win, 50% win rate is actually a good thing, anything higher than that and you’re going to climb ranked over 100’s of games. Don’t tilt, and if you do, take a walk or play some aram hahaha.

The touchscreen controls, gameplay, and pace of the game are incredibly well-tuned. They also play slightly differently than both PC League and Mobile legends.

Champions in WR are FAR more balanced than those in Mobile Legends... with less pay-to-win tactics. And compared to PC League, Riot did away with a ton of small elements that you normally need to worry about on PC to make the game more commuter-friendly.

You’ll notice this in game-time. Monster camps and minions spawn slightly faster. There are no inhibitors (inhibitor turrets instead, like Mobile Legends). And the progression from early, mid, and late game is much much faster.

Now, I need to address the battery usage. After only 2 games it drained 35% battery on a new IPhone 12. You gotta fix that.

Next, the controls are very bad. It’s good enough to play the game well, but numerous times I have went under a turret to destroy it, and it auto locks to minions or champions instead, even after locking on the turret. This is something you can do with the precise controls of PC league, but cannot do here.
I have accidentally used abilities, which is less important.
It’s also really hard to dodge skill shots. The skills stay the same in PC and in rift, but the drag of the thumb makes it much harder to dodge than the simple click.

Even if the game has been COMPLETELY CLOSED. THEN, it actually BANS you from matchmaking because you didn’t play the game it tried to force you into. I’m almost speechless.

I get that leaving puts your team at a serious disadvantage but there are more important things than video games. I just wish that you weren’t punished as harshly for having to leave.

Honestly I thought this would beat mobile legends  it I think I’ll go back there and uninstall this.

More often than not you end up with someone who goes AFK, a team without a jungler, two or even three people playing in mid/solo lane, etc. the matchmaking system is completely terrible, and they do not compensate you nearly enough for a griefing teammate or match you with the same level players. There’s no point in being SVP consistently on a losing team when the system is tilted against you. 

For example, they only give you +2 toward tier loss protection if a player on your team flat out leaves during the game, but it costs 300 protection points to save one lost mark for a game loss.

You log back in, it asks you to reconnect again. Doesn’t matter what you do, it asks you to reconnect.

544,App Store,"The nostalgia is real with this one, I used to play league of legends almost every day years ago but eventually stopped, I saw this by chance on the App Store and immediately downloaded it, the champion roster is slowly but surely bring back all the old favorites and the gameplay is just what I remember plus more, I’m amazed they were able to do it but I’m playing just as much as I used to back in the day!",5,Nostalgia with a twist!,,2021-07-28 08:47:59,,
545,App Store,"It’s a good game although there’s some toxic players here and there you’ll get used to it. I’ve become addicted to playing it after getting the ropes but one thing I find as a problem is you leaving the match and having a temporary ban. I get that the ban is there due to players rage quitting and such but whenever I leave the game, I needed to do something but after I got back in the game I got a temporary ban. I’m excited for patch 2.3 although it’s a good game, there’s always flaws so they did a good job!",4,Meh,,2021-05-20 22:01:59,,
546,App Store,I love the game play its a great adaptation of league of legends. I play it on PC as well. Cant wait for yorick to be added. The only downfall is the limited item pool and the missing rune pages. Kinda makes the game less appealing with the lack of options. Like there are no pink wards or blue wards. Makes invisible champs kinda Over powered like i can even teemo jungle which is kinda sad honestly. The active items also make it a bit weird. But overall good game,5,Doing great riot,,2021-06-02 08:33:16,,
547,App Store,The feature that can put its game bigger than mobile legends is skills matchmaking. Skills matchmaking is something that should definitely be in a moba game. I would love to see this feature be added next update in order to make others assure that they have teammates that are equal to their battlefield skills. Game is overall the best and I repeat the best moba gaming company in over 10 years. (Quote me if you want) it’s my words. Keep it up.👍,4,It can improve with one small feature,,2021-04-17 03:28:49,,
548,App Store,"I love the game so far and progression has been going well. For me, it felt much more smooth and easy to use since I also used play other MOBAs in the past. Some criticism that I have about the game is the actually loading into the game. Every so often I get bugged out stating that I failed to connect to the game even when I am on a secure connection and I tried every method to log back into the game. In the end it doesn’t work out so if possible I would love for that to be patched up! Awesome game overall!",4,Great game but minor bugs,,2021-03-30 18:50:46,,
549,App Store,"I have been playing league for many years now I’m still in love with the game and this is just an amazing format but I was playing with my husband and my game crashed I tried to login and it worked I actually managed to get back in the game I buy an item and I crashed again I waited for it to load and it didn’t and said I needed to update the game I did , also the game would not let me join so i waited for my husband to finish the game and I got banned for 20 min",5,LOVE THE GAME BUT..,,2021-04-05 20:28:05,,
550,App Store,"So this is by far the best 5v5 MOBA on the phone.

1. Your not bombarded by things to buy every time you log in. Mobile Legends was really bad about that. 

2. They give tons of free heroes from the start (by level 10 I had over 20 heroes and spent 0 dollars)

3. The attention to detail is amazing and graphics far surpass Mobile Legends. 

4. Game play is very smooth and they have extra tutorials that you can do for extra rewards & a better understanding of in game mechanics. 

5. I can’t speak for other languages but, this game is perfectly written and spoken in English. Most of the 5v5 MOBA’s struggle to write in the English language but, LOL does it very well. 

So I have uninstalled Mobile Legends and don’t plan on going back. Good job to everyone that worked on this game. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed.",5,30 Games in and it’s Awesome!,,2021-04-02 11:49:00,,
551,App Store,"One thing this game needs improvement on is the ranking system when they match u up with others it does not make sense if I’m a platinum 4 going up against emerald 2 and 1 players and my whole team is emerald. This is a serious issue it isn’t fair for the person that trying to rank up but gets put on a team where players play like bronze and they are considered emerald, it’s a big joke when I’m carrying the team even tho I’m platinum 4",4,Ranked is completeLy not fair,,2022-06-14 00:22:22,,
552,App Store,"The game has amazing dynamics and it’s very entertaining, but it’s too much devil, you spend 40 minutes in a game, at what cost? Stress because it’s a very competitive game and it’s not fun if you r not winning and all depends on your team, which sometime is frustrating and it’s just not worth spending 40 minutes playing with teammates that only care about their own game and performance and not about the team’s performance, not happy you try another game, and then another one, and then another one until you find out it’s a an evil game. Stay away from this.",2,Addicting game. Stay away!!,,2023-08-03 02:35:38,,
553,App Store,to be honest the game is good they just missing better champion with older spell from the first LOL like gangplanks ability sejani ult and other champion that spell has been removed I think they should have a rank AARam where player pick there champions 5 vs 5 just wow arena don’t matter if they have 2 of the same champion on each side cause it’s still a random setup the game can be way different from PC league,5,classic wild rift would be good,,2023-01-12 10:48:15,,
554,App Store,"I see a lot of reviews saying to “just play PC league” when a lot of people are trying wild rift because they can’t or don’t want to play on pc. So yes, wild rift is a really good high quality game. It’s still a mobile game though, and I don’t really think a huge competitive aspect is necessary. Have some fun on the rift and be done when you’re done, it shouldn’t be a huge deal. And if you want to grind and climb, do that. Have fun, don’t feel pushed to reach the top rank. But that’s just my cup ‘o tea.",4,It’s good,,2021-10-05 16:42:58,,
555,App Store,"The match system is still really bad, you expect to see pro player in diamond or emerald but what you see are players who play like they have no idea how to play… like come on dude… how are you in diamond with a skill of bronze…. Like its always the enemy teams that knows what they are doing and
Performing better while your team is completely bronze skills with a diamond badge,

if you compare it to mobile legend, majority of the mythic players actually knows what they are doing, only once in a while you meet bad players who don’t know what they are doing, but if you get autofil support in league of legends, its  like the worse thing can happen.",1,The best,,2022-03-16 22:59:29,"{'id': 28652553, 'body': ""Hello MonekyKing\n\nThat sounds like something we might be able to help you with!

Or being paired in a game where everyone is 0-4 and afkers. Punish the people who leave the game. The game itself is a great and fun game. But the matchmaking really makes it not fun at all.

Edit:  I’ve really loved playing aram and decided to play ranked again with the cool skin rewards that are offered!  

I’m actually quite pleased that they have upped their algorithm to pair better.  I do at times get paired with weaker ranked players but there is at least a note that they have been playing well.  In some cases the lower ranked actually plays better than the ones in my tier level.

557,App Store,"Awesome game and very well put together. If you love to play League this is an awesome mobile version. Honestly I’ve prob played more on mobile than pc as of lately, it’s just that much fun. Game speed is great and you do not lose the feel of overall game play. Also you can tell the developers are constantly updating and actually care about what is being released. Thumbs up for me !",5,Awesome mobile version 5 stars,,2021-11-16 21:41:08,,
558,App Store,I want to preface my review by saying that the coding and design are all solid and is very pleasing to the eye but playing the game itself often gets me upset due to the matchmaking where every other game there will be at least one instance of someone inting and taxing the rest of the team. Also the wait times on the ranked queue is insanely long where I on my first time I waited 20+ minutes before giving up and just playing ARAM. Riot please address this issue.,4,Solid framework mediocre execution,,2021-08-29 02:44:20,,
559,App Store,"the reason why I rated a 5 star is because it’s a pretty fun and good game compared to the trash game mobile legends that literally copied everything, yes everything, the skills, the modes, anything you can think of.

Anyways I know games will have issues at their start so I’m not mad but I do have concerns there’s been a lot of loading issues matches won’t start or it’ll have connection issues when I’m at full bars, and it’s been making the game unplayable and worst of all I’m getting penalized for it.

As for connections, I have been running into connection issues quite often when playing even on my home WIFI. The ping will spike and often times I’ll lag out during team fights, etc.

You don’t really feel the lead you get from playing well like in Mobile Legends, nor do you feel the sense of coordination and outplay you get from PC League. Everything feels mediocre.

Item customization honestly needs to be more flavorful.

Sometimes, I randomly lose control of my champ and they either won’t move, run in the opposite direction or auto lock on a target and run at them. So frustrating because it causes unnecessary deaths. PLEASE improve functionality, Riot! It tends to happen around patch releases. Ugh. 

Unless you want to spend $200 on a mythic skin or ~$60 on a mythic chroma, do not use the Hextech Loot system. It’s highway robbery.

I should be able to rise as a solo player without having to carry the team every game. It’s gets very frustrating and makes me want to stop playing. Also the targeting system glitches sometimes but that’s not a big problem.

Even though I cannot stand the idea of pc games having difficult controls, having this ported to mobile makes this game so much easier to learn and play!  

Here is an idea: since Mobile Legends are doing what you do, why not do what they do? 

The controls on PC are a challenge for a guy like me to pick up yet it’s so much easier on MLBB. Why? They already take your stuff anyways? Time to get a little payback, amiright?!  

As for the game itself:  Love the game, fascinated by the story arc. I was stoked I got to test my wits against MLBB but now, I’m eager to sit behind this game and make it home. Thank you, Riot for igniting my love for games again.",5,Mobile Legends knockoff.,,2021-11-30 05:56:16,,

Also please add FLAGS, and Special Characters in making Profile Names. Add customizable profile pictures also like ML and HOK. add World chat, server chat, country chats, groups, affinity like besties, partners, clan wars... and youll see how this game can take over ML.

-It’s league of legends in the palm of your hand
-Optimized really well for a mobile game
-You can chat with your PC buddies

Cons:
-It doesn’t transfer your skins from PC to Mobile
-Battlepass system
-All the champions are the same price which means grinding a lot

I think the smaller map size and simplified versions of abilities works really well especially for a mobile version of league making it more fast paced and less work to keep up with.

Sadly my only qualm with the game so far would be that the NA server got into access in the ""Second ranked season"" of Wildrift so all the previous event shop items and a Ranked skin reward is impossible to get other than that I think its a faithful adaptation of league of legends that feels good to play and is a welcome change from the pc version.

2. Find a way to ban toxic players. A lot of them just go unnoticed, and they have to be addressed.

3. Work more on the game buffs/nerfs. Every patch, there are a few champs who got adjusted just the right amount, but the rest are usually kinda dumb. Some champs even almost get “forgotten.” (as a soraka main, she needs to be buffed but riot hasnt done so in the past several patches)

I love this game but you got to do something about AFK. Most specifically the start of the Match, too much times i got AFK at the start of the game and I have to force to play a 4vs5 matchup.

Then at least add a function that if you're the MVP/Best player on the losing, don't make you lost any point.

Also, forcing people who already have existing accounts on the main game purchase characters and skins again is a cheap move.",2,"Same LoL, same boring",,2021-09-12 21:32:15,,

I love regular League, and I love Wild Rifts. 
I prefer the PC version, but when I’m not in the mood to sit at my desk, I can still get my fill.
My only complaint is that ARAM is only around for what feels like a very short period every once in a while, and sometimes I just don’t wanna play on the Rift and want something faster-paced. 
Regardless, it’s still very fun, and it IS League of Legends, but simpler and so easy for new players to pick up.

1424,App Store,Lots of potential but they kept so much of the toxic game design from the pc version so you may as well play that.
