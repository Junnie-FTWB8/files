0,App Store,2021-04-14 14:15:55,"This game is amazing especially when you compare it to the other games on the market. All the bad reviews I see and just pc players complaining about how it‚Äôs not the same. It‚Äôs not lol on mobile it‚Äôs mobile lol. Ofc you can‚Äôt react as fast and ofc the controls won‚Äôt be as smooth but you‚Äôre not on a pc you‚Äôre on your phone what did you expect, them to copy and paste the game and everything work the same ü§™.One reason is they aren‚Äôt constantly trying to get you to spend money after every game you play. Another is no character is so extremely op that they can literally kill you by themselves with two auto attacks like in mobile legends or arena of valor. It‚Äôs very balanced. Because it‚Äôs so balanced teamfights actually matter and they aren‚Äôt just a spam of abilities and whoever has the most dps wins. I don‚Äôt wanna make this review too long bcuz then no one will read it but the only problem I have with this game at the moment is that sometimes you‚Äôll get out in a game and everyone will pick their characters and then the game will say failed to connect and when you try and rejoin it says the game already ended. The games isn‚Äôt in your match history either which shows that it‚Äôs not just your WiFi cutting out.",4,Best Mobile MOBA by far,,,
1,App Store,2022-05-18 07:52:45,"This game is made beautifully! There for sure is a lot more to come since the PC version has been out since the stone ages and there‚Äôs, I‚Äôd say, less than half the champions available now on the mobile version.
There‚Äôs always an event happening and getting materials to buy new champions is fairly quick. I‚Äôd say too quick to be honest, considering most events you get the new champion for free if you participate.
Mechanically not the greatest but compared to other MOBAS for mobile, it‚Äôs one of the best. 
One thing I don‚Äôt enjoy about Wild Rift is matchmaking. I‚Äôm no pro and far from one, but it‚Äôs hard to rank up and when analyzing how much damage I am doing and even absorbing compared to my teammates, just about every other match I do and take nearly the most besides a tank and maybe a support if we had a hybrid. Sometimes even more damage than the entire enemy team which is hard to ignore. It would be nice if ‚Äúskill level‚Äù was not based on more than it is now which seems like it‚Äôs just your current rank. One other improvement I want to speak on is being able to see skin effects before buying them. If I am going to purchase a skin for my earned money, I want to know what it comes with such as sound and visual effects that change with the champions skill like the ‚ÄúArcade‚Äù series. Anyways, still excited I don‚Äôt need to be on PC to play one of my all time favorite games!",5,Best MOBA for Mobile hands down,,,
2,App Store,2021-11-11 08:09:36,"So much better than Arena of Valor. Wasn‚Äôt expecting decent gameplay on mobile platforms but on the iPad Pro, this game is phenomenally good. Buttery smooth frame rate at 120fps, not a hitch in graphics at all on a 3rd gen iPad Pro, if you have something newer then you‚Äôll be good for a while as well. Like that I can log in with existing account for Riot. You can buy buttons to stick on the screen if you don‚Äôt like the thumb movement control. I tend to slide around further than the designated circle for movement. Everything else is fine though. The game is easier to play on a touch screen than I would have imagined. I would like to see controller support added though. Arena of Valor was put on Nintendo switch and it works fantastic there. Better yet, put Wild Rift on Nintendo switch as well please, and don‚Äôt separate it from the mobile player base like AoV did (that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs dying on switch). Since apple has allowed controllers via Bluetooth, it should be considered for moba titles on iOS/iPad OS. The only other gripe I have is that nothing transfers over in terms of purchased characters from the PC version. You do seem to get a new hero every time you level up though which is nice. The premium pass is cheap at only ten bucks for extra funsies. Bring controller support and allow things to transfer over like purchased hero‚Äôs and skins and this game will be by far the best moba on mobile platforms.",5,Unexpectedly good,,,
3,App Store,2022-07-17 06:47:02,"Never married before, but I haven‚Äôt touched grass in eleven months since I started playing, so I probably will never have the chance again. I played Wild Rift first on my iPad, after seeing many friends constantly on League proper. I played for a number of months, learning all the champions and grinding ranked. Eventually, I felt like I‚Äôd reached my limit, and because of how good this (mobile) game is, I purchased a PC to play the full thing! But to my surprise, Wild Rift still stands in its own right and is as good as the game in many places, sometimes MUCH BETTER than the original. Weaker points are mostly related to superficial factors, the frequent empty headed plays from people playing at work/in class/etc, feeders or inting players, toxic individuals in chat, leavers, and so on. Where the game soars is in its excellent pacing of each match, the punishing but also extremely enjoyable ranked systems(and now legendary update!), and the graphics that are somehow better than the main game. I mean, seriously, the fact that the client interface looks better than the PC game puts those developers to shame. All this to say, Wild Rift team has created something that will be around and exponentially permeating through mobile society for many years to come. I‚Äôm excited to see where they take both the casual and competitive scene from here. INSTALL THE GAME AND ENTER THE RIFT!!!",5,This Game Lost Me My Wife and Kids,,,
4,App Store,2023-01-12 05:00:41,"Great game! It‚Äôs league but at the convenience of being accessible at your fingertips. Yeah, there are short comings especially compared to it‚Äôs counter part being played on pcs, macs, and other computers. You can‚Äôt expect the full experience while being on a phone, but, you still get reactive, real time combat and controls, tons of different characters with their own unique abilities and own influence on the overall strategic play through of 5 versus 5. Game mechanics make it extremely insensitive to players who lose connection or have their own phone die during game, resulting in a disciplinary ‚Äútime-out,‚Äù requiring players to wait until their able to play a match (without any possibility for you to defend the reason behind why the ‚ÄúAFK‚Äù happened). Also depending on server maintenance and your own internet ping, you may experience a terrible game simply because you cannot react in time due to time lapse in between members of the match. Lastly, many people say it‚Äôs a harsh game on people who pay to play compared to the free to play players. It‚Äôs absolutely wrong! LOL has ALWAYS been a free to play game. If you want to look cool and buy a skin then go ahead, but it‚Äôs the people who know the mechanics, implement strategy and never even have to pay a dime of RWC that actually dominate this amazing game!",5,LOL on a phone!,,,
5,App Store,2021-06-09 23:29:55,"First let me just say, for those players who are saying just play pc league need to stop because there is a good market for mobile play and honestly some people don‚Äôt have the time investment to play an hour long game and some people don‚Äôt have PC set ups to run smooth games. Do not be discouraged by the reviews and try it out! It‚Äôs got amazing graphics, very smooth gameplay that has a greater emphasis on teamwork, a nice clean interface that isn‚Äôt too overwhelming and other little baubles you can play around with to customize your gameplay and controls to fit your needs. There is definitely room to improve but it is still in beta so it‚Äôs not even the full game yet.

As someone who plays mobile games and specifically mobile MOBA‚Äôs, I can honestly say that Wild Rift is something that blows most other mobas out of the water. Obviously with league to base off of it‚Äôs bound to be good but what sets it apart from games like Mobile Legends or Arena of Valor is the fact that it feels strongly team based rather than a heavy reliance on over powered champions to make a random team comp in order to overwhelm a more balanced team. There are certainly overpowered champions that can carry in WR too but at the very least you can come back with some patience.",5,Wonderfully made for mobile!,,,
6,App Store,2022-01-29 20:31:38,"The game overall is fine. However when the LoL community has been asking for major improvements for months they never deliver. The worst thing that can happen is a ‚Äúchat ban‚Äù. However these same kids are still ruining games and refuse to surrender causing suffering for 4 other players. Riot you need to step up your game and start giving out harsher punishments. Instead of an‚Äùtemporary chat restriction‚Äù how about a Ranked restriction? Where the player cannot que ranked for 2-8 weeks. This game used to be fun and competitive however it‚Äôs over run with the same toxic PC community. It‚Äôs a little insane. I tell myself ok I‚Äôll try again tomorrow and the next day the first 5 games include all toxic children or leavers. Makes the game not even playable. I hope this reaches out to a game dev or someone. You guys need to fix match making to have limits too. Being Diamond should not allow gold/plats just because the ‚Äúsystem thinks their doing well‚Äù. It should absolutely not allow people two entire tiers below you. Literally ruins the game. It should be iron/silver gold/plat Em/Diamond, not allow a gold 4 in an emerald 1 game. Anyway. You guys need to stop dropping the ban hammer and get control of this toxic player base in NA. Speaking of which, I live in the United States. I am never paired on teams with people who speak English. Latins need their own server. I haven‚Äôt seen another player who speaks English in months.

7,App Store,2021-04-04 06:44:32,"It‚Äôs fun for an occasional game on the go, but it‚Äôs nothing compared to the original PC version. The controls are a bit clunky although I don‚Äôt really play mobile games. The auto targeting is a little buggy as some long range abilities such as Lux‚Äôs ult will sometimes lock on to a jungle camp instead of the enemy champion, and for melee champs it is difficult to target an enemy champion if they are standing too close to minions with only your finger and not the precision of an actual mouse. There‚Äôs no draft picking at this time so champ select can be rough, especially when you get queued with newer players who may not understand roles. I‚Äôve ended up in a few matches with only supports on my team, which wasn‚Äôt a fun time. 

Some additions to the game such as mirror lanes are completely unnecessary and make things more complicated than they need to be, especially for newer players. I opened a ticket with Riot to see if there was an option somewhere to disable the mirror lanes, and the person who wrote me back said that there wasn‚Äôt but agreed that it caused things to be messy! Hopefully if their own team thinks this they will add an option to disable it soon. Also with as much time and effort as I‚Äôve put into the pc version as far as unlocking champions and skins, I wish at least some of that could carry over, rather than treating this as an entirely different game.",3,It‚Äôs ok but much prefer the original version of League,,,
8,App Store,2021-06-01 06:15:16,"The game on mobile is pretty fun. I like the idea and concept and have a good understanding of how LoL works. I dislike the matchmaking and how it is not skill based (especially your teammates) and hate that I‚Äôm having to carry every game in order to get to higher ranks. That‚Äôs not a big issue though because that‚Äôs to be expected in almost every game.
My main issue lies with the fact that on random days for random amounts of time, I won‚Äôt be able to play games on my main account. I‚Äôll log in thinking I‚Äôll be able to play a game while I‚Äôm on the go and then find that I don‚Äôt see my friends that are online, my profile picture, my rank, and the wild pass. All of these things are just missing and at first I thought it was a wifi issue but when I made a second account that issue wasn‚Äôt happening on that account. This bug is super annoying to deal with especially because I did grind events to get skins on it and would like to use them. This bug also makes it so that every 10-15 seconds you get a loading ‚ÄúL‚Äù (the League of Legends symbol). This bug fix would make the game much more enjoyable and fun.
Overall it‚Äôs a good game the concept and idea is super cool. Would also love to see more game modes that we see on PC like URF, ARAM, etc.
Sadly, until this bug is fixed I will not be playing this game and will have it uninstalled. 
So, FIX THAT ASAP PLEASE.",2,Loved the game on PC but there‚Äôs too many bugs on mobile...,,,
9,App Store,2021-11-18 23:13:07,"Probably the best MOBA I‚Äôve ever played.  I‚Äôve tried other MOBA on iOS and they can‚Äôt compare to this game.  This game combat is so much nicer and polished than others.  You don‚Äôt have to worry about auto targeting at minions when being ganked or in 1v1.  Other MOBAs had those issues even after I messed around with the settings.  Everything seems really balanced and I haven‚Äôt experienced games where someone would 2 shot me mid-game.  Champions and skins are actually obtainable by just playing the game unlike most other MOBAs I‚Äôve played MOBAs where you would have to grind forever or wait till events pops up just to have half of the price of the champion you want.  HUD is really good and doesn‚Äôt cover your whole screen and the lighting is nice and smooth.  Although Wild Rift‚Äôs champions have been fleshed out more than their competitors, the champions designs and abilities are really nice and doesn‚Äôt seem too uninspired like other MOBAs I‚Äôve played.  This game is a little more competitive than other MOBAs I‚Äôve played but who doesn‚Äôt like a little challenge.   Would definitely recommend this game to anyone who‚Äôs into MOBAs because of the more polished gameplay and the minimal grinding for skins and champions compared to other MOBAs.",5,Best MOBA,,,
10,App Store,2021-06-09 16:31:39,"This game, first of all, lemme start out by saying this. I‚Äôve NEVER in my 6 years of owning an iPhone, EVER submitted a review on ANY game. But this MOBA? League Of Legends: Wild Rift? This game truly is something else. I find myself playing this game for what feels like only minutes at a time, only to realize that 4 hours of passed, and I remember I need to take a break every now and again to give my eyes time to relax themselves. This is the ONLY mobile game I have ever spent THIS much time on, and never ONCE got bored, tired, mad or agitated at. I never played the League Of Legends game on PC. But why would I?!

11,App Store,2021-04-03 17:33:57,"I‚Äôve been playing league since 2011 and have a pretty good understanding of the simple to intermediate aspects of the game. One aspect of wild rift that is almost non-existent is the support role. There is no ‚Äúsupport item‚Äù tabs, but there are some support items but you have to dig to find them. Though there is an easy way to target enemies, there is not a option or function to interact with allies quickly. This makes targeting teammates almost impossible during a team fight and renders the support useless.
One key feature of this game that is incredibly frustrating is the character control speed vs. skill shot speed. I would HIGHLY recommend a tweaking of this system. In pc version of league, reacting and dodging skill shots is almost instantaneous because of clicking. However, the transition to mobile kept skill shots at the same travel speed, but users now have to drag their thumb across a screen to dodge skill shots which delays the reaction time. I have never had this much of an issue dodging skill shots on the pc and the above reason is my opinion as to why it is soooo much harder to pull off. 
I will be deleting this app until these (mainly the support issues) are addressed. I also have an issue with not having access to skins I paid for in the pc version of the game. If money was exchanged then I believe I should have access to that item in all versions of this game.",2,"It‚Äôs ok, but missing key components","{'id': 22041994, 'body': ""Hi Mintberrycoon,\n\nThat sounds like something we might be able to help you with!

     The game is fantastic so I give it five stars, but the legion marauders infinite multiplier take 1 star away. Since there isn‚Äôt anyway to heal between the marauders and Swain, another star is destroyed (see how the game plays?). For the constant hammering of Swain taking 1 from nexus without offering a way to balance the fight(usually starting with 15 or less on nexus) another star is destroyed.

With the roles I understand the importance of everyone being active in the match and the desire to punish those who go AFK or abandon the team. Yes that can be annoying.

Sometimes life doesn‚Äôt let you play uninterrupted. Maybe you‚Äôre in the middle of a game and you have to make a choice between life, family, friends, and a GAME.

My problem is not with the game itself but the player base (obviously not everyone). League is already an extremely toxic game, couple that with the mobile multiplayer base and you have a recipe for disaster. The toxicity seems lower at first because of the hassle of chat on a mobile device, however the problems occur more in game than in chat.

I know this game is pretty fresh but guys... Listen. I left this game a lot of times and came back on every big update and its... NOTHING. You focusing and working on wrong things. Match making system is the biggest broken thing in this game and second one is AFK and TROLLS. Whats happening? Its realy that hard to put some main things from pc version to receive a better quality of gaming? Where is a dodge system from matchmaking? Where is an early surrender if some1 goes afk and points doesnt lost? Another one FAIL. You said working on mmr and fixed it. What did you fixed? I got 4 ranked matches in a row with unranked, bronze, silver teammates, while i m in emerald. Whats this? Who will give me back my lost points of your system fail? Its impossible to play solo que and a lot people will agree with this. At first Focus on the gameplay, not on your wildpasses or other things. I played few times MOBA LEGENDS and i can say guys uhhh, you need a loooot of work to reach that game level...  I thought you will be more ready for mobile version, but for now its just more stressful game than fun. Because 8 loss streak and all of afks and mmr system fail its not fun.

It gets a little frustrating losing games because people simply haven‚Äôt been given enough info to know these basic things. Done with the negative on to the positive. This game is amazingly built. No it is not the same as pc but in some ways it‚Äôs even more enjoyable.

     Why? My interpretation of the patch notes was that some players couldn't control their emotions and would start fights with their own teammates and/or the enemy team. That being said; there is a convenient 'mute-button' next to each individual player that can be toggled at any time during the game. On top of that you also have the ability to toggle 'All-Chat' in the settings. 
      Anytime I play this game now it honestly feels so  empty and disconnected. I almost never see anyone using the chat system anymore; just from taking away the ability to communicate with the enemy team. 
     Now I realize the game is not designed to also be a social platform, it's designed to be a competitive game, but couldn't there be a compromise? Couldn't we keep 'All-Chat' in normal games and take it out for ranked? 
   Anyway, Riot tried to remove all-chat on their desktop version of the game but the community strongly rejected that idea. Wild Rift unfortunately doesn't yet have a strong enough community to fight back the removal so Riot got away with it.",2,League of Meh,,,

From the walk animation to the champion models themselves; even the map looks like it‚Äôs from 2010. 

There are a few cons that I would like to point out which mainly centers around the player base themselves. Simply put, the lower you are, the more trolls and toxic people you get as teammates and that can be very annoying. Even though I am in Grandmasters, this happens often as well.

Improved my rank from gold 1 to plat 2 very quickly.  It seems like the game noticed my above average play and has penalized me by giving me bad teammates or trolls for 12 games in a row.  Literally 2-12 and my winning % now dropped to 50%.  It‚Äôs so frustrating.  I want to enjoy the game but one feeder just ruins everything.",1,I want to like this game so badly,"{'id': 23975668, 'body': ""Hi Freaver1,\n\nThat sounds like something we might be able to help you with!

When I saw wild rift it was amazing that I can carry and play anywhere just on my phone. I love the addition of both old and new characters. I do agree with the comment replied to you especially with the ranked mode. I am having difficulties ranking up because of afk and intentional feeding. Ever since I started playing ranked, it‚Äôs been one loss and one Win. It gets frustrating because you aren‚Äôt going anywhere. I believe that developers should add more shield or give more shield to players when ranking down. It is annoying that you are playing so hard and you get crapped over by one person on the team. I understand that that everyone is here to play for fun but many players do not show good sportsmanship and I hope lol can find ways to rectify this problem. There are players who are frustrated and most times just quit  mid-game. Wild Rift in general is a great game to learn and have fun.",5,Bad sportsmanship in ranked,,,

The heroes for LoL are much better than other mobas, but i have only one major complaint about this game. The abandonment system is terrible. I abandon three matches in a week, and i have a two hour ban i have to log in to activate. Lets say i have to do something so I am forced to abandon my match. Three hours later, i log back in to a screen that says ive been banned for 20 minutes. Ok. I do it again, only for an hour to be added every time i abandon in 7 DAYS! It is applied to every gamemode, even AI matches. I dont play ARAM, so I dont know if this is the case there. I am now sitting here with nothing to do because i had to go three times in one week. It is stupid, please make a new system. Otherwise, the gameplay is excellent along with the brilliant event systems and how it is the perfect amount of grinding for each hero. But please, this is ruining my experience. Thank you.",4,The abandon system,,,
49,App Store,2021-04-03 21:46:21,"The game is awesome and so much fun to play. I think Riot really put the time and love in on this one. I‚Äôm happy they took their time and made sure they had something special before they released it. I see some people complaining about the controls however I haven‚Äôt run into any issues and think they work great and suit a mobile game great. In a lot of ways I prefer this game to the PC version of league, I think the matches are more intense and move quicker. The smaller number of champions is refreshing and makes for more balanced and approachable gameplay in my opinion. 

The only thing I would recommend at this time is controller support. I think the touch controls are great but adding a controller would really be appreciated by those who use them for other ios games, and especially those playing on an ipad. Since Wild Rift was supposed to be the same game on mobile and consoles controller support would definitely be conducive to this.

Again awesome game and thanks so much for the hard work!",5,Amazing! Read!,,,

Its essential to making the game feel fair. 10-30% of my games on a daily basis are lost to afk or trolling teammates that don‚Äôt get punished properly. Meanwhile the chat ban starts at 68 hours. That‚Äôs how long an afk ban should be if there‚Äôs no afk protection. Way too long for a chat restriction, flame is mean/annoying while going afk/inting ruins the enjoyment of the game for everyone. So PUNISH the players actually ruining the game please. #2 - Lee sin. #3 - wild pass stops.  There should be unlimited rewards even if it‚Äôs just blue essence IMO  #4 - lp gain/loss should just be even no? It‚Äôs kinda infuriating to win 1 lose 1 and actually be lower lp that you started especially when that loss is to an intinf player that can just queue up again

51,App Store,2021-06-02 16:37:55,I picked this up after playing on PC for years. One thing I love about this game is how fast the games are. I‚Äôm the kind of guy that likes to play every single champ. In pc league of legends it seems to take hours and hours to really lock in how a champ works. Say for instance you accidentally throw your first game with a new champ. Instead of waiting 30 to 40 mins to try again wild rift makes it 10-15. I‚Äôve found myself learning champs in wild rift Rand taking that knowledge into league of legends. It‚Äôs almost like a training ground for your micro play. Also if you get into the competitive aspect of the game your macro will be tested as well. You have to make your decisions way faster and the effect of your decisions is made clear much sooner in wild rift than it is in your regular game of league. I highly recommend playing wild rift if you‚Äôre new or just need some decent practice. Any PC gamer that plays this and doesn‚Äôt find the value in it is missing out.,5,Job well done,,,

 The ranked systems LOADED TO THE BRIM. With boosters win traders hackers dcers hard feeders account swappers or the ladder.  
Lemme explain.  The game used to be better cause you had bronze and silver feeders and boosters in the bottom of the barrel ( where they belong ).  Now as a plat / emerald.  I play ranked and get people dragging bronze and silver low Ello feeders who think they are better then BRONZE. The game used to be fair balanced and aside from feeders the worst is the cheating.  Mostly damage amps defense amps ward hacks/ sight hacks and BOT FARMERS. If you don‚Äôt get those ( 7/10 games this year.) you have duos bringing first timers in ranked cause it‚Äôs not protected with a limit or min requirement. So you‚Äôll be emerald - diamond matched against a full emerald team and some douche brings there bronze lvl 10-20 buddy.  The matchups are normally 15-30* ranked division difference and you get the shafted end 9/10.  The game needs to bang harder also and look into better anti cheats.  I shouldn‚Äôt see bots almost every night. I rarely play 6-10 games a night or even a week if I‚Äôm lucky . That‚Äôs TO MUCH. For a game like leagues.  Do better disgraceful",1,God awful for ranked.  Sligtly better for normals.,,,
53,App Store,2021-04-30 18:28:09,"Now, I'll start off by saying that the PC and Mobile version [cannot] be compared.  Why?  Because they are two completely different platforms with communities that look for different aspects and are accustomed to different types of controls.

Wild Rift is basically a bite-sized version of PC League that includes the major parts of the game (minions, turret AI, economy, and roles).  It's more suitable for players that want to play this game to kill a little bit of time and not have to play a whole full-fledged battle.  The devs did a good job at simplifying stuff by desaturating the amount of detail on item effects.  If makes it easier for players to learn the game and to make it feel less overwhelming.

The only thing I love about this game is its faithfulness to the original and its platform-appropriate adaptation.

The only thing I don't like is how the support role has a lack of presence.  In the time I have played this game, I have not sensed a support player ever.  They felt like dead weight that just followed the team, which didn't seem like it helped or punished anyone at all.  If the PvP mechanics of Wild Rift were at least a bit more similar to League PC (in terms of healing and slowing), maybe it would help the Support role feel more valuable.  Otherwise, we could run two ADCs and disregard Supp.

The reason why I am giving this five stars is because of how the controls and the goal of the game were adapted well.",5,For those coming drom LoL PC,,,
54,App Store,2022-07-15 07:37:00,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love the game. However I don‚Äôt love the people playing. I match up with players that are obviously feeding and trash talking the team and no matter what I do or say they don‚Äôt get any repercussions. 

Recently I just played a game where one of my teammates banned my pre picked champ and was completely throwing and feeding throughout the match. They never helped their duo and they ran away from team fights plus they did not help when asked. Because of this one person it ended up causing me and 3 other people to lose a match which is so unfair. They were blatantly griefing and no matter how much I report them NOTHING HAPPENS. What? They get warnings? Can‚Äôt play a couple games? That‚Äôs not a worthy penalty. They literally ruined the game and made it less fun. It‚Äôs frustrating how these players get away with it so often to the point where I give up reporting all together.

55,App Store,2021-12-04 00:03:09,"Overall the game is satisfying to play. The controls are straightforward, itemization is easy, and the game is condensed enough to be fit for mobile without it feeling watered down. Matchmaking, however, needs fixing and can make not only ranked but normal games unfair and unpleasant. Grandmasters can play in lobbies with silver players in norms and ARAM- that should never happen, even late at night. Every time this happens, the game‚Äôs outcome depends entirely on whether the master+ player wants to try. As for ranked, climbing on low ranked accounts can be so difficult it‚Äôs not fun anymore. I am low platinum matched with emerald/diamond players every match, which makes me not want to keep playing to reach the rank the game thinks I should be in. To climb I either need to consistently beat players better than me or throw matches until I‚Äôm back with people in my rank. Let me play with people near my skill level in unranked matches and don‚Äôt put me in ranked lobbies where I‚Äôm 2 ranks below everybody else.",4,Matchmaking needs fixing,,,

As anyone could guess they are the reason I dropped out of Diamond because every loss is -15 lp and every win is 10. I strive to be the best and low elo players only hold me back when I would rather be playing with players better then me to become better. I also dislike how people can abuse the 5 player system in ranked when it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúSolo/Duo.‚Äù Some players can get free wins by doing the bare minimum because their friends can just carry them. Ranked is suppose to make you in particular a better player. I soloed 85% of my games to Diamond and find it frustrating always playing against 5 mans who just abuse the ranked system.

62,App Store,2021-03-31 18:44:18,"Wild Rift is the next evolution for League of Legends, an upgraded engine, upgraded models, quicker games and as the title implies a ‚ÄúWild Rift‚Äù. 
The map is varied and randomized allowing for on the fly gameplay changes. 

For anyone saying the touch screen combat is clunky I have to disagree, once I got used to the controls I was stomping on people. Being able to run while autoing and the ability to quick cast on character direction/placement allows for some quick twitch reactions that main client just doesn't allow and makes escapes much more possible and reliable rather than having to just give up and let the enemy team kill you because you‚Äôre too slow. 

The only cons I have with Wild Rift is that there‚Äôs a lack of item variety, having more active items like galeforce or zz‚Äôrot would allow strategy and gameplay to breath and make choices more important. I also think Runes would be better if they were the full system from main game rather than the weird mixed tier system currently implemented, not being able to use Dark Harvest on Jhin is no fun, if I‚Äôm mobbing the enemy I should be able to have a high risk high reward rune that supports my play style if I‚Äôm doing good. If you could Riot, please add some modern client features such as Legendary items, potions, additional runes and more boot options.

For instance player ‚Äúpipluppiplup‚Äù literally said he‚Äôs going to troll when game started and then proceeded to run into the towers in a rank match. Next game I get paired with this player again and he proceeds to do it again. Player ‚ÄúElmigue97‚Äù decided he didn‚Äôt want to jungle last second and instead lane with adc and support as akali. He then comes down to my lane where I am nasus and then proceeds to take my creep then goes back to base or into the tower.

I understand that every player has a choice when it comes to choosing heroes, but it is fundamentally crucial that this hero at least fits their lane or role somewhat. For example mage/spellcasters as a jungle? It is Incredibly hard to get a good game from that composition. And yes I have communicated with these players but it does nothing and reports does nothing either. At first I noticed players trolling in casual, but now they troll even in rank.

89,App Store,2021-05-17 18:16:26,"League of Legends: Wild Rift is a mobile adaptation of the PC League of Legends. Wild Rift is a relatively accurate representation of the Summoners Rift which many of us have come to know and love. This game is literally packed with potential for breaking the mobile MOBA competitive scene into mainstream, here‚Äôs my current pros and cons.

PROS:
1. Accurate representation of League of Legends.

2. Faster gameplay for those not wanting to sink too much of your time into a single game.

3. Beautiful visuals, better than the PC version in my opinion.

4. Ranked system is much more fair compared to PC version, less likely to get hard stuck in divisions you don‚Äôt belong in.

5. Unique Wild Rift items, many of the new items Wild Rift introduced are brilliant and should be in the PC version.

CONS:

1. Lack of champion pool, this is only a current issue and will be worked on in due time.

2. Unbalanced characters, suffers from the same issue as PC League of Legends where some characters are a bit overpowered and others seem to be entirely forgotten about.

3. Lack of draft mode in normals.... Anyone who dislikes blind pick basically has no choice but to play ranked.

Overall I give this adaptation a 4 of 5 stars for being such a strong MOBA experience despite it‚Äôs current beta stage. Some small tweaks in needed places will give the extra needed boost to be a 5 star mobile title.",4,Incredible Potential!,,,

Unfortunately for Riot they have not found the balance between rewarding good players and punishing bad ones. Just today I‚Äôve been playing for six hours straight and have not moved up more than two mark points. I‚Äôve been saved over and over again by my mark loss points thankfully!

I‚Äôve been up in diamond and honestly should be back there now. However it‚Äôs hard to move up when it‚Äôs an afk then a newbie who really cannot play well. Or players who have zero game IQ.

That's a price of widespread adoption on mobile platforms where the solution  is to find friends to play with.. I don't think it's fair to blame the developers for that.

You cant tell me that a person of sane mind can die 10 times in first 5 mins of the game while being in grand master/master tier. Which is happening every single game. This is either win trading or extremely toxic people who should be banned/flagged. This can easily be fixed by increasing punishment for bad behavior, or queueing toxic people with toxic people.

That being said, if you are coming to this from LoL like I am, you may have to adjust to using a touch screen to direct every movement, spell, and auto attack. If you also use unlocked camera often on PC, WR only has locked camera with a mini map you can 'check' on. 

The controls feel responsive. (with a good internet connection) Some spells have added range and effects to emphasize what they do. Minions will tell you they can be executed at a certain health threshold. All the champions I've played or played against feel balanced and effective for what they do. There's also a lot of communication pings. Perhaps too much.

The summoners rift ping lady screams. A lot. In addition, you have the power to spam her voice. I do not use this power gently, and never hesitate to spam ping ""RE-RE-RETREAT!"" to someone that cannot understand I called ""Baron Lane."" 

Which brings me to my biggest complaint, a lack of verbal acknowledgment from teammates in PVP or even Ranked. Too often I have queued calling a roll, and after locking in my champion would a random teammate hijack the lane playing whoever.

A way they could maybe fix this is to rank you up based on a points system and your own performance since there‚Äôs already a feature to see what percentage of a certain champion you did better than after each ranked game. Another thing that can make ranked super annoying is that when teammates disconnect for THE ENTIRE GAME making it a 4v5, it still counts as a loss. A way to fix this is to have that game not count as a loss while the winning team has it still count as a win but get no ranked fortitude from it.

2. What if there was a tournament where everybody puts in 100+ crystals and it is a free for all or team fight where the winner gets all the crystals or the team gets an equal amount if crystals (the winner would be guaranteed to get 20% more than they put in)

First, moving champions on a touch screen actually making the action of moving more accurate and smooth. It‚Äôs easier to have to keep clicking my mouse very quickly to move them around on pc.

Second, I like the faster pace of the game. Each game could run as fast as 10 minutes, and a long game doesn‚Äôt go over 30 minutes because of its simplified map (but the game is as fun). I remember I used to have some 50+ minutes game when I played it on PC and it was very tiring.

Third, I like the variety of events it has. It updates it‚Äôs events frequently and it has fun and useful rewards.

Last but not least, kind of related to my first point, when a champion is moving on the screen, the screen automatically move with it so my champion is always at the center of the screen. This is a life saver as I don‚Äôt have to drag my mouse to move my screen around like what I did on the pc version.

And some matchmaking issues like there are people who are waaaay lower than the ranks they are playing with. I saw unranked playing with a diamond ranked in RANKED. 
Oh and one other thing can you work more on ability interactions? I will give u and example (if you stun lux when she is using ult. She will ult anyway :/) these kind of interactions.

Advice: add another option for controlling pls like VAINGLORY its controlls were waay easier and smoother than joystick type. In teamfights you could use what to do easier and faster u can do it like this too but touch control was waaay faster.

Proposal: can u stop randomly adding champs to wild rift? Ask the players what to add next. Its not like you are gonna make a new champ you are just adding them from LEAGUE OF LEGENDS with a few differences.

One thing I noticed though is that the character selection phase (right before the game starts) is GOD AWFUL. Although this flaw isn't enough to ruin the game, it is definitely something that needs some work. 

If you don't already know, when selecting what characters you and your teammates will play as, they're all sectioned off into their respective roles so that you'll know what your characters'role is. Sounds great right? Well there's just one small problem. UNLESS you are an experienced League of Legends player, and you know the role of every character, you will NOT know what role you teammates are playing. When teammates pick their character, you are not told their role unless that specific player says ""I'll jungle"" or something like that. 

This flaw makes the game very unfriendly to beginners because they aren't told what role is needed until all other teammates choose theirs. If this is fixed, it will make the game much better for new players who don't know all of the characters yet.",5,Character Selection Problems,,,

158,App Store,2023-01-26 19:06:41,"While the graphics and characters are spot on with their desktop counterparts, the game play suffers from some hardcore oversimplification that makes it entirely too easy to get stomped by easy to play champs. Seems like every match has a Vayne and/or Yi who just runs rampant and ruins the experience for all the other players. Then there‚Äôs the leaver penalty - Riot needs to understand this is a MOBILE game, and sometimes people have to put their phone down. Granted if it becomes excessive it should be discouraged, but setting your phone down to deal with a real life issue should not be penalized by a 150 second matchmaking delay for PAYING CUSTOMERS. Extremely disappointing. That doesn‚Äôt make me want to avoid the matchmaking penalty, it just makes me want to avoid spending money on this app. If I had time to focus 100% on the game, I‚Äôd be playing the desktop version anyway.",2,Terrible adaptation,,,
159,App Store,2023-10-07 19:33:56,"The issue with the ranking system is that it allows for individuals to climb up fairly easy with barely any experience in the game. In comparison a person with 2000 games with the rank of Edmiral is matched up on the same team with someone who has 300 games. The disparity is, is the game knowledge for the person with 300 games. And that also reflects in a game experience. Individuals with 300 games are still not map aware and are still learning champions. The whole ranking system is broken to the point that is almost unplayable. We expect individuals to play their best. But yet play the worst they could ever play. AFK - I‚Äôm not sure if this is a connection issue or an issue with the end-user. But the make up is not as fluid as it should be. A person can play a game for 10 minutes and all of a sudden another player decides to go AFK. At that point the only thing you‚Äôre going to get out of Wild Rift is fortitude.

I saw an ad that announced the mobile version and I immediately got it to check it out, finally a quality pc game on mobile! 
I think they did a good job adapting the game,but movement is way harder than on pc which is weird since on pc that only needs the mouse phones are touchscreen.

1. At first I thought this was a major flaw but I sorta understand it. You can‚Äôt cross-platform with pc! I thought it would be great to play with my friends on their PCs from anywhere on my mobile device, I thought this could be really awesome but I guess they don‚Äôt want that.

First and foremost, the game is extremely balanced with robust characters. However, one thing that I find lacking is the amount of competitiveness. The game is in a great spot but out plays are basically none existent unless you are a character that has CC or huge burst damage. Characters die too fast while items that gives magic resist and armor provide less survivability. Tanks such as Mundo are the only ones that can fully utilize equipments like the tank item that increases healing. Not only that, healing or life steal are nonexistent.

No one follows the roles even though it‚Äôs already preset as their strongest roles. And people like DarkRaven should never ever be allowed to play games like this ever. The amount of negativity and toxicity from him just put me off completely from this game. 

People like him should be completely blocked off from any game owned by this company. It just very off putting and just messes up with the whole experience. Been a fan but right now all I can say is this should be deleted off apps store until the developers can come up with a better control over how the community should be. 

Great game, big potential but sad about how it‚Äôs refereed. There should be a mental psychology test for each new account. The game characters and their speeds are quite slow too and it feels like you have to break the screen to just move your character to a certain fight area even with added speed.

198,App Store,2021-05-29 05:06:17,"My problems are twofold: ranked matchmaking and toxicity?

In matchmaking, why do you even bother to ask what role you want to play when the percent chance you actually get it is so low. Why force players in RANKED who choose to specialize in a particular role to play things they don‚Äôt want to or are not good at which severely increasing the chances of you losing. Theres not a player in sight that wouldnt mind waiting a bit longer if it meant they always got the role they want in a given match.

While I‚Äôm at it, why does Riot continue to penalize people in ranked a loss when people go afk for extended periods in a match? A 4 v 5 matchup in most cases is a guaranteed loss. Why should everyone have to suffer for it? Thats not fair at all.

Now, the toxicity in this game has not improved at all. My friends and I left the PC version because of this and are about to do the same with mobile. Reporting legitimately bad behavior like threats or hacking does nothing. Instead, you get penalized time off of your play for reasons that aren‚Äôt within your control like a lapse in your connection.

There is a surrender option for games that have been decided, but it‚Äôs woefully underused. 2/5 players can hold the other three hostage in a completely lost game.

Is it any wonder that players are toxic when they realize a bad play means they‚Äôre spending the rest of their available play time going through the motions and getting one shot by fed opponents? 

The surrender threshold needs to be lowered, maybe dynamically with the scoreboard. If 2/5 want out when the score is 2/18 then they should be allowed out.

some improvements that i think would be nice:
-optimize the targeting options to not cancel an auto midway 
-allow the use of abilities while auto-pathing somewhere (e.g., i have pathed to top lane and want to use a speed-up ability to get there). currently, this is not possible and the character stops moving if they use an ability while auto pathing.
-in targeting options, separate minions and champions for the options of ""Target by Lowest Health (Absolute)"" and ""Target by Lowest Percentage Health""; I've missed a couple of minions due to the auto target honing on the half health cannon even though there are casters about to die.

I just started dabbling in ranked mode, quickly climbed up to silver, but recently I queued up and the game immediately gave me 999 ping.. I checked my cellular and I was 3 bars of 5G.. then the game force-updated itself and I missed the first 10 minutes basically of a ranked game, that would of been fine if the ranked algorithm didn‚Äôt take me down to silver 4 from 3‚Ä¶ after it already did this once before and took me from 2 to 3. I love ranked and climbing but it‚Äôs completely unfair that I play ten games to get to silver 2 and then get demoted to the next tier down‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt be playing this game for a while or spending anymore money on skins.

The sped up version of the games allows some champs to be virtually unkillable after 2 or three kills while some champs who are ahead in terms of kills have been nerfed significantly that they do little to nothing in team fights even with a considerable lead.

It makes me more frustrated than actual LoL as most games are either won or lost before champ select is over since you may end up with smite lux top lane, instantly losing you the game.

- sometimes during a match the audio gets muted abruptly and that freezes the screen where players give a like to other teammates at the end of the match, therefore gives us no choice but to reset the app.

- when you transition from app to app for more than few minutes, wild rift automatically logs you out, but logs back in if you exit the app and open again or you can just log back in.

- Also the circular controller on the left bottom side of the screen is doesn‚Äôt work precisely and it feels kinda hard to go to directions you wanna go.

The paid currency is also scummy since you can‚Äôt buy the exact amount for a skin and you will always have some left over.

If i remember correctly its used to be a much smaller rank gap for who you play with. Being plat i should only be able to play with gold and emerald. This makes the games much more fair as you wont have some scrub on your team. A lot of people have smurf accounts so when you get a brand new player vs a smurf your going to automatically loose the game. Please fix this.

The touchscreen controls, gameplay, and pace of the game are incredibly well-tuned. They also play slightly differently than both PC League and Mobile legends.

Champions in WR are FAR more balanced than those in Mobile Legends... with less pay-to-win tactics. And compared to PC League, Riot did away with a ton of small elements that you normally need to worry about on PC to make the game more commuter-friendly.

You‚Äôll notice this in game-time. Monster camps and minions spawn slightly faster. There are no inhibitors (inhibitor turrets instead, like Mobile Legends). And the progression from early, mid, and late game is much much faster.

they walk into melee/bruiser range as a ranged/squishy
they walk into turrets,
they engage in 1v3 fights despite team pinging retreat.
if i am pinned or caught they will engage instead of saving themselves or defending
everyone always teamfights and no one cares about objectives.
please add a deathmatch mode,
or arena mode
or something, to help keep certain crowds among different ques.
or possibly add a smaller 2v2 or 3v3 option.
or possibly add a larger 10x10 option.
having objectives is nice but i think having a capture the flag, 
or king of the hill
would help with some of the playerbase.
if there was an endless mode similar to those .io type games i bet it would be super popular,",2,upsetting game experiences,,,

The game itself lacks a lot of the momentum I like from league of legends. Everything feels rather low stake and low impact. You don‚Äôt really feel the lead you get from playing well like in Mobile Legends, nor do you feel the sense of coordination and outplay you get from PC League. Everything feels mediocre.

Item customization honestly needs to be more flavorful.

Amazing graphics, more profile/gameplay/interface customization options, and overall less toxicity than LoL. In terms of gameplay, I prefer WR way more and like that there are frequent events. 

Cons:

Sometimes, I randomly lose control of my champ and they either won‚Äôt move, run in the opposite direction or auto lock on a target and run at them. So frustrating because it causes unnecessary deaths. PLEASE improve functionality, Riot! It tends to happen around patch releases. Ugh. 

Unless you want to spend $200 on a mythic skin or ~$60 on a mythic chroma, do not use the Hextech Loot system. It‚Äôs highway robbery.

2: Pings. Honestly I LOVE pings, but I hope that the max could be 2 at a time. Even with the limit already, people still spam ping and it gets very annoying.
